# Intention
# Actions
- Nostalgia. Finding clues. To their past. Lets you go further back. Flashback fights. 
- Static noise that progressively gets louder as the video becomes more and more uncanny over time
- Tornado sirens. 
- The sound suddenly cutting out
- Eyes that aren’t necessarily looking at you, slowly shifting to look right at you
- Blink and you’re dead. 
- Sound suddenly cutting out or dialogue glitching/looping. Reminds me of being a kid when my CD player would glitch, scared the shit out of me
- I only know of one game that does this but the thing where the spooky image just slides into frame slowly.
- Images appearing in menu 
- creepy ass dog following you. Trying to warn you. Keeps pulling you into dialogue.
