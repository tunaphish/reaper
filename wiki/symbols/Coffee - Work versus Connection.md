Coffee as an allegory. Start of each mission they get some coffee together. Mentor always likes to go the same place. It's consistent. He's a professional. Expected to get it done. But he's accepted his station in life. Coffee is old wave, drip. Bitter. Additional scenes show them trying new wave coffee but Mentor is initially turned off by it. Fun scene with them discussing poop coffee.

Eji and Sei's story is a personal one. a story about regret. Sei likes traditional first wave diner bitter coffee. Eji has him try new third wave coffee. Visibly makes a face "it's sour". it's not bad. It's just not coffee. Eji and Sei are both hardworkers. Eji is more callous though. Youthful. Brash. Headstrong. He's like the sun. A big theme is their bond together. Forming it and eventually. Breaking it.

- Reflect on your precious mission. Brief on the next. 
- There is no urgent matter. You have to create your own meaning. 
- Or maybe places with coffee offer a time of contemplation with your team. Coffee and connection.  Coffee and duty. Duty versus connection. People drink over coffee. But they drink it for a purpose. Sei uses it to advance missions. Others use it to chat.
