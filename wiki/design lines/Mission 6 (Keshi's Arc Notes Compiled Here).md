- You cannot always prevent turning
- You can’t do it alone. You need Elise’s help to reap sei. 
	- Elise is missing. Retroactively decides fate based on ending with sei. 
	- Keshi is second to last mission after you kill all the other reapers
	- Eji is emotional and keeps him from being a good reaper to the dissapointment of his team who are trying to find the reasons they stayed behind. 
	- Elise’s emotional arc should be first. But they should all culminate at almost the same time. Maybe it’s being a die character. But she’s the one who stands in the end. Being the main character. Romanticizing your life. You never could afford the smucci bag. She ends up shoplifting it. 
	- You’re left with strong feelings of regret which spurn you towards it. Or maybe just the general mystery of reaper society. 

	- - after They successfully execute keshi and sei calms you down. There’s one final task. Execute sei. 

- the snowstorm a loss of connection. people are distant. but they gather. they gather around bonfires. you find sei by himself in a field of snow and purity. he's completely cold. The snowstorm breeds fire and connection due to the nature. 
- you are going through the battlefield finding remnants of reapers and reapt souls. going through the town. finding empty stores and lifeless areas. it’s grown away from you. sei has to be stopped. There was a natural disaster. Everyone you know and connected with in this town has died. There's a huge list when you wake up this morning. This is when you find that 
- attack from ally: Fight with elise. the climax of mission 6 is the fight with Elise. This is her confrontation with her weakness. Even though she has emotional intelligence she still doesn't feel and accept them. She understands, intellectualizes, and robotically processes them. But she does not feel them. Your fight with her depresses her and she laments that she wants to have her negative experience with reaping Keshi have meaning. She wants so badly to do it.. but she can't face sei in battle. The initial phase with sei has you fight him alone.


- Time skips. Killing off the previous generation. The snow storm. The one that kills all the towns people. 
	- Reaping their loved ones causes them to remember. They can become reapers because they forgot what kept them behind 
	- The storm claims Keshis mother. Causes him to start turning. He’s angry. Angry at this unchanging world. He’s already turning. 




# Elise's FIght
- I got to work. And run. And meet people. Sit in the sun. God I was so lucky. I did those things. But it didn’t matter. Because I didn’t have more. 
	- But you deserved more
	- It doesn’t matter. I will never have gotten more. If all I had what all I was gunna get. I could’ve cherished it. Now it’s over. We were so lucky eji. You and I are. We’re the same. No tragedy. Just useless people. Withering away. Until we died
- The final date. Perhaps Elise is about to turn. And seis about to reap her. Or force eji to do it. You keep getting pushed. You’ve failed before. With keshi. Another time? 
	- - Elise date. I want you to kill me. Switch to flashback. Goes back to battle with her.
	- Elise recalls the first lesson of the game. She’s crying.  Then she stops
	- There’s no way. You’re done crying
	- No. But I have to kick your ass first. Then I’ll finish crying. 
	- She stands up. The final battle with sei triggers. 
	- The first phase you were by yourself defending against sei. 
	- Elise unlocks final flow.  

# New Mission 6
- Keshi's Death
- Rei

- You don’t understand anything eji. 
- I loved. My mother. 
- I think I put most of his notes in his profile
- - distorted versions song plays throughout
	- Regular version is playing for intro. Teases what’s coming. He turns as the song distorts into the one you were familiar with. 
- Keshi makes it out like she’s living it up. 
	- you examine the clothes in the room. The all incredibly cheap
	- then You find out he was sick and spending it on her
	- you go inside another final flashback. I’m a fighter too. You think it’s keshi the whole time but it’s the mother’s flashback. I’m a fighter too…
	- I want to live!!!  I wanted to live. Just one more month. More day. One more second. 
- Just… one… more… breakthrough...
	- - Keshis literally in the edge after finding out he was remissing
	- DO NOT. GO ANY DEEPER. 
	- He’s gone eji. There’s no coming back.  
	- umbasa falling. 
	- AHHHHHH
	- I. WANT. TO. LIVE!!!
	- That’s why you’ll never understand. Above it all. I want to fucking live. 
	- If yoi expose yourself anymore eji you will lose it too. Is that what you want. To make Elise put you down. And to put her down myself. 
- give vague clues that point to conflicted nature.  Disgusted with mother for being whore. Disgusted that she did this for him. 
	- Disgusted with himself for wanting to live despite what it meant his mom had to do. 
- because you are attacking his Keshis moms spirit there’s ambiguity at first with whose mind you invaded. It’s assumed to be keshi but it was actually the mom. 
- 	- Elise and her sister were always fighting. The conflict was there. When she stopped fighting. She stopped caring. Her sister would always fight with her. They stopped fighting. Her sister started to hate her then. Siblings were conflict. But that’s what gave it life. Her sister feels bad about it but can’t change her ways
		- She finally snaps during the wedding. Starts screaming at her and calling her a stupid bitch. 
		- Don’t worry you’ll find a good man like your sister. 
- keshi is a fighter. first part of the arc. dad always taught him to fight. keshi starts a deserved fight. because he was angry. dad caught up in it. shot? tells him to fight. then later on his mom needs money for cancer treatments.. blah blah.


- It means hurting the people that deserve to get hurt. It means protecting the people who get hurt. Keshis father was a fighter. Keshi got into a fight and father got shot. Told keshi to become a fighter. He’s the man of the house. Mother never had a job. He was always the one taking care of her. Now she’s by herself. And keshi got sick.  
	- we all fight. But we’re not all gunna make it. But we all fight. Because some might. We all fight. I’m a fighter eji. You make me fucking sick. I’m a fighter eji. He was presumed to kill himself. But he kept going to eventually the cancer overtook him. 
	- What do you do when fighting means others are dying. What am I supposed to do when giving up means she can live. 
	- He played rock paper scissors with her to the end. 
	- you learn he was a fighter in the first half of the game. Arc with the dad ends there. 
	- Keshi gets sick in reaper world. You try to get him to rest. He’s useless against boss. But he won’t stop. Because he’s a fighter. 
	- He takes off his muay Thai headband. You give it back to him. To remind him. He’s a fighter. 
	- He remembers his mother stopping him. You are a fighter.  I am a fighter. 
- 	- I am a fighter. 
- The violence is the answer. Fighting is good. Put down our fists eji. Talk it out. Nah. I’m gunna beat the shit out of you. 

- Keshi please. If you do this… it’s over. Please. Eji… it was over from the beginning. (This was always my fate. ) This is all I know. 

eshi's Fall
- Keshi starts attacking the team
	- Glitch and he's on the other side
	- Girl is flooded with emotion. Attempting to user her is almost impossible. Level 10 confusion
	- Sei joins allies and has to heal and defend until eji can stabilize.  defend until eji can stabilize. 

- I thought my anger was the issue. My rage was holding me back. From being like you. Like you and sei. But that wasn’t it was it. It doesn’t come from holding yourself back. No. It comes from being true to yourself. It comes from my anger. 
- Then what does that mean for you. If my anger is who I am. Then your detachment. Is who you are. You’re just being true to yourself. 
	- When will this end. It will never end. Because it lives on. In all of us. No matter which one falls!!!
	- Unstoppable mindset. 

- - Why I tried to hold it back. Why I couldn’t keep up. Why I couldn’t fight. But that’s it. It wasn’t about stifling.  It was about following your nature. Why deny who I am. Because I am angry. Isn’t my anger a part of me. Isn’t that what makes me strong. And just like you. It’s in your nature. To stifle. 

- keshi fight
	- Eji. Eji. Calm yourself. This is what we trained for. This is why we’re here. 
	- Speaking your mantra. 
	- Keshia whispering to you. 
	- Eji…
	- Eji. 
	- Even now. 
	- I’m glad it’s you. 
	- If you let him get up sei just strikes him back down. He screams in anguish. Please sei I can’t do this. 
	- Eji it needs to be you. Keshi wants it this way. this is what you were looking for. What you were trying to avoid. 
	- I’m dead. I’m fucking dead. What wa the point. If I realized it sooner. We wouldn’t be here huh.
	- - Slash at him
	- AhHHHH fuck. Why. Why. Why whwywywuwhwyh. Even now. Ah hahahaha. 
	- - Hand tattoo when he covers his face during battle. 
	- Going through the execution process

- he had cancer. Mom did onlyfans to pay for it. It remissed. He killed himself. It’s why keshi shaved his head. - Mama's Boy
	- killed himself cuz his mom started onlyfans
	- killed himself to because of embarressment?
	- no to save her...
- - Why is it. That when I’m angry. That’s the real me. 
- It didn’t matter. I did it for her. Look at her. Look at me. What was the point eji. What was the fucking point. Ahhhhh

- The final phase of keshi fight is them as kids. During the fight they talk like their adults. 
- keshi hates eji at the end. 
	- After you reap keshi. You get the text. Next target. Sei. End of chapter. Aleph. 


# Keshi's First Stand
- Fuck it’s him. 
	- Yeah you’re right. Let’s go
	- … keshi?
	- Keshi lets go. 
	- Ke… 
	- Keshi stands up
	- shi…
	- “KAT…”
	- “TAI!!!!”
	- Cuts to cut scene of keshi walking to camera. And framing himself. It’s an exaggerated portrait
	- As he’s walking. They say this. 
	- what the hell is he doing
	- He’s seriously just walking up to him
	- Battle transition
	- Keshis portrait is still that exaggerated frame
	- what the hell were you thinking
	- Shut up pussy. I will NEVER
	- Stand down. I am a fighter. 
	- - Anger doesn’t just shake randomly. It shakes to the fucking beat like it’s reverbing. 
	- Keshi is angry and it’s shaking to the beat. 
	- Those how his anger manifests. As focus. 
	- In the future they can never do any kind of plan that involves a retreat. Otherwise keshi will just full send. 

- First time keshi directly shoots as part of the plot 
	- Next time it’s the game mechanic
	- - Part of it defines how mechanics for stealth mission starts. And then keshi just fucking beams the security guard 
	- Last time is an environmental design (did you catch that)
		- Something that can happen in background of scene 
	- https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8wwpK6n/
		- Illuminated by fire from the bottom. They stalk their kill. The parents. They kill the person who abused their child. But their child only wanted to be with them. Alternate story for keshi instead of
		- Onlyfans mom. Sought revenge. And this. He seeks revenge. - https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8wwpK6n/
		- Illuminated by fire from the bottom. They stalk their kill. The parents. They kill the person who abused their child. But their child only wanted to be with them. Alternate story for keshi instead of
		- Onlyfans mom. Sought revenge. And this. He seeks revenge. 
		- It's why he's a fighter
		- Revelation map for keshi fight
			- he's alone later in life
			- his parents loved him early in life
			- his parents are in jail
			- his parents killed his abuser.
		- It should be an allegory for keshos sexual abuse. His starlight was taken or some dumb bullshit. I need to actually watch animu and not tiktok and play games and read books. 
		- Don’t ever let anyone take anything from you. You fight. It’s in my nature. It’s in my blood. All I know is how to fight. 



# Climax
- Dad please. Let’s just go. Please. You did enough. You’re scaring me…
	- Look of conflict. Keshi's dad relents. He reaches out to keshi
	- Keshi instinctually flinches. 
	- Look of anger. Gunshot. The final gattai 
	- Keshi face splattered with blood
	- Fight begins
	- That’s why I’ve always hated you
	- In the background police siren wailing. You’ve never fought for a thing in your life. 

- Keshi's dad reaches out to him to walk away. Keshi flinches. It triggers his dad
	- In the future Keshia girlfriend is sexually assaulted. He beats the shit out of the guy. It’s revealed she lied. Keshis vision goes black. 

- - Eji starts tweaking diring fight. Does one more dive in desperation. Turns out they enter his mind. Find out there’s nothing. Keshi gets mad at obviousness of what's going on in Eji's mind. It's a small foreshadowing of what's to come
- - Eji… I’m tired. (He’s been wide awake ready to go this whole time. )
