# Premise
- Reaper is the journey of a young man, Eji, who died and is seeking purpose as a reaper in the after life with his 2 companions and mentor Sei exploring a nostalgic but modernized world of old school JRPGs and vintage anime to reap the previous generation of reapers who refuse to move on. 
- Dealing with "regrets" and the chains your life burdens you with

# Story Structure
1. Weakness: **His weakness is his lack of autonomy and decisiveness.** Sei gives him purpose as a reaper. But that's not enough. The journey is to learn what to do and how to live his life even when Sei is gone. 
2. Need: He must make his own decisions and live with autonomy. 
3. Desire: Eji lived a toothless life, having never bitten down to anything. An observer to everything but never having lived his own life. Upon his revival as a reaper he has amnesia, this is thought to be due to some trauma he was not able to process... however, it's because he has nothing worth remembering from his previous life... He tries and tries to figure out what happened in his life to cause him to regret it and remain as a reaper but it was the fact that nothing ever happened. He kept waiting for life to happen. 
4. Opponent: Sei - There is no Meaning to Life. The Reaper. We all die. Who cares. The reaper is a structure set in place by Sei. Just follow it along and you'll be fine... As long as you follow the structure who cares about what you decide to do. 
5. Plan&Battle: Confront Sei in the Snowfield. Sei is trying to force you to reap his friends (and take his position as Reaper) but it's your friends and the people you choose to surround yourself with. 
6. Self Revelation:  He must make his own decisions and live with autonomy. 
7. New Equilibrium: Presumably he continues his life as a reaper with his friends. 


# Moral Theme
Reaper explores the moral theme of navigating the regrets of the life you lived and the choices you make when deciding your present and future. After dying Eji is confronted with taking advantage of 'another life' and using that to live the best life he can. His mentor Sei, gives him a goal and the means to achieve it... but is this what Eji wants?

The life you lived is does not need hold you back. You can do anything from this point on. Right here. Right now.

# Design Line 
- the plot is delivered potentially out of order? but there are several major hubs. maybe take elden ring map design as inspiration where there's a strongly implied happy path order. there's lots of revelations and uncovered souls. 
	- gunna do hubs with major bosses and sub bosses within the hubs. players can run around and do misc things within the hub and uncover additonal layers of the boss. 
	- the final "dungeon" is legacy dungeon style? you pretty much can't leave until you close it out (maybe you can teleport). for example the CEO tower. you progress upwards. after boss kill it pops you back into the intro. and when you load the game back up there's a debriefing and you're back at the convenience store.
