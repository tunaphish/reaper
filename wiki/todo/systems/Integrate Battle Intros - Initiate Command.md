# Inspo
- Blackout, Psychogenesis

# Systems
- Tap everyone to fight to begin channeling aura
- magic is the source of depression... techniques have weaknesses...
- conversation with them, trying to get to know them... okay we're getting into dungeon design now... flashbacks and shit. talk to them.. finding their soul
	- alternatively it's all mixed up around and you progress through their memories in order... perhaps it's difficult to solve the riddle of each person... as you defeat different aspects of them throughout the world... no phase. 
	- oh.. so that's how it is. you guys were never my friends huh. you never were there. 
	- maybe you learn new fucking things. new fucking techniques. I do love a guided journey but maybe dark souls style exploration where more of the map begins to open up and it's like pseudo open world in the sense that maps lead back to other parts of the map. 
	- anyways 
- this is also a consequence of the convergence of dialogue and combat.

- There’s a fight where someone doesn’t want to fight you. But they’re cornered. Or you suspect someone or some shit. When all of a sudden. You see their health box start storing aura. Keshi starts in response. Then he yells at you to start accumulating aura. -
	- Maybe this is the intro to girl and the first time you see someone start accumulating mana from dialogue window. 
- Someone teaches you a technique to always have it up so you aren’t ambushed. Like a fucking anime. 
	- Don’t want to teach them how to always have running. I like the tension building of accumulating aura. 
		- perhaps they have you develop your intrinsic technique instead - sharingan, reciprocity etc. 
- She’s the bomb devil! Boom fight starts 
- trying not to alert them that you're anti reaper squad? not really liked.. wait.. i'm not.... you bitch. starts accumulating aura
- Depending on situation it’s different for spawning aura. When there’s dialogue to be had you don’t auto start. When enemy is not conscious spirit everyone just auto starts. You can accuse people of being lost souls instead of just human btw
- There’s a known asshole and all three immediately start posting up. 
- keshi's intrinsic technique is that he gets a free tier 1 ability, basically a sucker punch. enemies are often caught off guard by this
