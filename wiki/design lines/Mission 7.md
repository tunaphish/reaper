- Eji's amnesia never existed. He never had purpose. Sei knows this and is similar in this regard. 
	- "- Then why did I stay behind. Everyone else had such. Goals. Such beautiful feelings. I had nothing. I have nothing. "
	- "I just wanted to feel something... anything"
	- "- No. You sought purpose. And that is my gift to you. reap me. And find fulfillment in life. Or let me wallow in mines. And watch as I real you. "
- Sei has been alive for a long time doing this. 
- the final revelation is to accept all the bad and the few good in life. ala everything everywhere.


- Sei is a reaper reaper. He stows away his emotions for the good of the world. And he uses this tactic to reap the other reapers.

- Sei is the final target for reaper. You are to become his replacement. He's not what this world needs anymore. He's an era of a different time.

- 'They're going to die anyways. What does it matter what they feel when they go.'

- You realize during the final battle that it's not for the sake of the mission but for his own sake. "You can't do... you can't do this job. Without becoming like me. You are too kind Eji. This is your final lesson Eji. Reap me. If you can't. You are too soft for this world. You aren't what it needs."

- It's not just what they feel when they go. It's what they leave behind.

- montage of reapers you've meant. what you have done for them.

- one mission has them remember their lover (or child?, mother went on without them) (potentially sei's old backstory).

- Shot of ava drinking.

- Shot of sei's final resting place.

- Ava hates me because I reapt her lover.

No. I hate him because of the way he did it.

a story about changing generations. loss of traditional masculinity. blending of roles. sei is sexist to a degree. women in the workplace. maybe not too overtly.

Throughout the battle hands grab onto Sei as you wear him down. These are the burdens and responsibilities he carried with him. They weigh him down to this day.

"Sei. Please. I love you." The final hand appears over Sei's neck. You go to reap him. The hand blocks it.

Phase 2 is the hands giving him strength. Responsibilities hold you down. But they also give you purpose. They give you life. Having people depend on you. The next phase is you striking them down.

To live for others. To find responsibility in life. Sei was never happy. You break him down by letting him know what the job has done to Eji. Is this what you wanted for me? Sei wanted to protect Eji. To keep him from the darkness that consumes him.

The game ends with you taking down sei. sei's story is one of nihilism. you can do everything right. live a virtuous life. have the right amount of fun. find the perfect partner. but still leave life feeling like it wasn't enough. sei's mind wouldn't let him be happy. yet he still hoped. trying to rouse him positively is almost impossible. you have to appeal to his nihilism. this life. everything in it. wasn't worth it. nothing is. arms come from the ground. each one and arrow through his heart. and drags him into the ground until there's nothing.

Sei is still mentoring you even whilst kicking your ass. Dxrk rave song is playing. (Maybe not)

AVA: Do you want to cry

EJI: I don’t know how

Eji I have to die. Humans don’t change. Humanity changes. The young can only thrive when the old die out. 

- Eji: Sei please.. I love you
- Sei: I... I.
- Sei: I need to pass on Eji
- Sei: I can't do it Eji, I need to die.
- Sei: So you can do what you need to do. So you can make the world a better place. I'll always be me. If people were immortal, power would always centralize around them.
- Eji: Fuck.
- Eji: Fuck fuck fuck.
- Eji: Fuuuuuuck.
- Eji: She's even younger then me.
- Sei: Eji. Don't let your emotions blind you. Everyone dies. Some sooner then others. You know this.
- Eji: I can't do this. I can't do this Sei. Sei please. Just this one. Just one more time. Please.
- Sei: Eji. I know you can do this. You wanted to make a difference. I see it in your eyes. You can do it. Here's your chance.

- you're the only one who can do it eji. the one who can take on the burden from everyone else. to do what needs to be done. when ava couldn't but down elise. I did it. 
- - why couldn't we help them when times are easy. 
- you train during peaceful times for the hard times. you have to always be hard. to put away that part of yourself. to do what the world needs. if you always took the easy way, would you be able to do what needed to be done when it counts. 
- sei took over and killed his own master.
- final area of discovery 


# True Ending 
- Eji attempts to use the positive tactics he's learned. 
	- Due to the rules of reapers it does not work 
	- Sei: You tried. We all do. 
- You have to use negative tactics to depress Sei (this part reveals a bit about his life)
	- why did you leave me behind.
	- why did you leave me with this burden?
	- I'm so proud of you...
	- but can I really curse you with my fate
	- I guess it doesn't matter anyways
	- it never really did
	- this is the way it is
	- the way it always will be 
- The game gives you the option to reap Sei
	- It can end there.
	- He is proud. He's trained you well. There will be someone to carry on the torch. But he's depressed. The cycle will continue.  There's no escaping it. There will always need to be people who need to get things done. Sacrifice themsef. Their feelings. To do what needs to be done. 
- However, if you wait and then start using positive tactics after he's been depressed you can extend the final battle just a bit longer for the true ending. (time to pretend - lazer boomerang)
	- Elise joins the battle at this point, after a few mediocre positive attacks. (eji is good attacking HP but Elise is great at emotional manipulation)
	- Sei admonishes them in the lack of meaning. 
	- I already told you eji... elise... it won't work. 
	- I've already tried. Everyone tries. But there's no point. 
	- You start reminiscing together. 
	- Sei tells you a bit about his past. His mentor
	- He tells you how he's forgotten why he even stayed behind in the first place 
		- I thought to myself. It'll be a year and I'll see these leaves again. And nothing will change. I will still have these problems. I have seen the fall leaves so many times since I have had that thought. 
		- Sei: Anyone who might have been able to do it isn't here anymore. By my very hands. 
- Finally when you reach a sufficient amount of positivity. He offers to play a [[Reaper Games - Arbitrariness of Life, Games, Meaning]] of rock paper scissors. It goes on until you select scissors. 
	- There's an automatic cross cut over Sei (two slices like he's being reapt by scissors two people. Reapings usually only ever happen once). 
- True ending: there's a montage of the stuff you did over the game... maybe how you reapt everyone. 



- Sloth (Acedia)
	- - There’s a symbol and you feel alive. It burns brightest when you are fighting sei.  Then it dims again when it’s over. Fire. 
	- Eji was an artist -> he has empathy. he feels too deeply. Sei teaches him to stifle such that he can remove how he feels. 
	- The final lessons our fathers teach us. Is that we are alone in this world. 
		- Will you walk the path of the man. Who faces  your death. Or will you foolishly cling to life. L guide others to a destination you cannot go to. And walk the path.
		- Of the reaper. 
		- How can you sit through it eji. Days after day. It’s so hard. Was it always possible? Why did you have to show me this. Show me pride. 
		- If you go through the story stifling. He talks about that. If you go through empathizing. 
		- These feelings. These struggles. It’s life. 
		- - The only time you experience the fire is when you use willpower. 
	- - Don’t you feel alive sei. 
		- Eji is struggling as much as he can to stabilize his emotions. After he finally does. He looks back and keshi is dazed. He’s on the edge. 
		- What do you mean there was always a choice. I could’ve always. That them. All of them. They always could have. Is that what it would mean to have had a choice. Agatha. Rei. Zabuto. Keshi…. Eji.  We always had a choice. 
		- you can just sit there and fucking lie to them. what does it matter eji huh. why would I spend these final moments just to lie to them. when they'ree leaving anyways huh.
			- it matters ot me
	- It's hard to feel the things you feel. To live life. To not only feel the things you feel. 
		- it's so much easier to not feel anything. to push it down. to try and avoid these things. 
		- to stay with your emotions. to feel what other people feel.
		- what point is that. why would i do that?
			- but sei. don't you feel it.... don't you feel alive?
			- The fire only burns, when willpower is used. that's why there is no satisfaction with no effort. 
			- YOU DON"T THINK I FUCKING TRIED? HUH? THAT EVERYDAY WASN"T A FUCKING STRUGGLE> TO EVEN OPEN MY EYES. 
	- part one is going through sei's past. he has to reap everyone. then you go through eji's past. lack of anything. there was no purpose. stuff down what you feel. 
		- how can you know what it's like. your life 		
		  - you had no purpose. there was no meaning to your life. no grand tragedy
		- a life lead one day at a time that never had any kind of meaning. 
		- that was it then? that was all? that was all I had to do. Just do it? just fucking do it? Ah. AHHH. AHHHHHHHH. AH AHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA. 
		- Okay then. let's fucking do it eji. let's do it. LET'S BE ALIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. 
		- pull the fucking trigger BAN. KAI. 
		- why are you even here? what's your purpose? why did you stay behind? 
		- I'm here to let you move on. 

- - Keshis memory joins you for the final phase of the fight. Options fade away and you can only execute. Chain. 
	- sei. As a man you have to take the burden on yourself. You have to put away the human part of yourself to do what needs to be done. 
	- Greed forgot himself in his greed. But there was still purpose in that 
	- He is the reaper who reaps his Bethren. But he himself cannot let go unless he knows someone can take his place. 

- Game state. Execution state. To do finishing blows. And game states for playing rock papers scissors. 
	- During Sei's final phase he has Counter/Reflect which means no matter what you can't hit him. You have to distract with Keshis soul by playing a game. Then eji and Elise have to execute scissor style. 

## Themes
- It's worth it... even for one moment of positivity it's worth it. All meaning comes from within. How you feel. Meaning is self determined. You cannot escape death. You cannot escape sadness. But you can still forge happiness in the meantime. 
- If he can't do it by himself. They can do it together. 
- Complexity of human emotion. You can be sad and happy at the same time. Conflict within. 
- Eji was always seeking purpose in life and into death. Becoming a reaper perverted that purpose. Being with others and sharing in happiness. That is life. That is purpose enough 
- Face your emotions. Even though they're hard. They hurt. They hold you back from achievement. But they are what it means to be human. 
- Accepting your own emotions even if you can't fully understand them. Sharing in the sadness and happiness with others even when it's pointless and hard. 

- Learning to feel. Avoid emotions. Learning to empathize with them. Because their journey was your journey. By avoiding emotion. By avoiding empathy. You deprived your life of meaning. You existed just to exist. But by learning to feel what you feel. And feel what others feel. By the power of friendship. You are able to find purpose in your shitty life. Your trauma was the lack of trauma. You withdrew. You took the safe bet. You had no story. No narrative. Your character was trying to find out why he’s here. You can only randomly stumble upon it. By avoiding conflict. By avoiding emotion. Sei chose to avoid it. To avoid the negative feelings. But you embrace it. The end result is the same either way. Life comes to an end. You have to reap sei. But you can embrace his philosophy. Nothing matters. Avoid emotion. Avoid conflict. Avoid empathy. Or you can embrace it all. And find. That it does matter. 
	- Sei is also an observer. He can precisely avoid your attacks. First stage is him setting up your emotions. Then second stage he loses stoic and can make mistakes because of his emotions. 
	- So tell me eji.
	- What’s it all for.  
	- This. Right here. What were doing
	- Don’t you feel it sei. 
	- Don’t you feel… alive?

- Opening song plays during seis final phase. So so ending credits. He gets beheaded and and loops back to main menu smoothly. 
	- Thank you for playing reaper!

	- the ennui comes. all the same. no matter what. 
	- episode sei. basically it repeats. over and over. him killing his companions. each scene changes who he's with. until the final fight where it's multiple phases against all the final people. until the final scene where it's sei against Eji and Elise
	- He pushed down his emotions. so that only duty remained. That's the only way you can 'live'. But is that really living
	- anyways you were with sei during episode sei and then he goes against you
- Crystals
	- sei during the final fights after you say that his is what it’s all about
	- Third phase. Intro song
	- something happens with the white hair. Yeah!
	- Starts showing all the characters. They flash in as vcr glitchy effect but they’re blocking sei. You gotta kill them one by one. They dance their way out as their outro credits and get executed again. Maybe them dancing was the dancing intro as well. 
	- When you play the final rock paper scissors. 
	- It shows the final Quattro outtro. 
	- You slice his head off.
	- Seis final outtro and title is the reaper. It’s the one that gets sliced like everyone else’s outtro. The slash reveals the SCHWINGGGGGG. 
	- from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for playing the reaper. 

- it doesn’t take months. It doesn’t take years. It doesn’t take a lifetime. To be someone else. It takes one moment. . . Would you dance? 
	- Eji flashbacks and you reflect on your journey. 
	- I thought I told you kids to stay in the car. Extra scene of them all dancing together. 


# you're gunna carry that weight

	- You're gunna carry that weight.
	- You're always gunna carry the weight of the actions in your life.
		- Even the action of inaction.
		- As an artist he had the weight of expression. The possibilities. Always had the freedom. 
		- But he never chose for himself. He never lived the life he wanted. Now the rest of the world. The audience carries that weight.
