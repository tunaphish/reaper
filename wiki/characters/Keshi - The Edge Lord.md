Keshi spent his whole life defending his dad and what he did. But when his dad reveals he regrets doing what he did.  Because he didn’t get to spend time with keshi. He freaks out. He can’t take it because that’s what he always wanted. His father’s love and time. But because he loved and respected his father so much he wanted to make his decision make sense so he loved his life embodying the philosophy that lead his father to make that decision. But his regretting it means that he did all that for nothing. 

Blow for blow. Stand and trade. Keshis Bankai.
