- Classes and Customization
    - Skill expression in JRPGs mainly come from creating your builds
- Level up at coffee shops after. Where you rest and relax
- classes should be extremely distinct. they're distinguished by comparison to other classes.
    - what classes CANNOT do

- Lots of JRPG Skill Expression comes from customization and preparing your units for battle rather then the battle itself where players can mathematically arrive at the 'correct' answer and use reactive abilities to heal when necessary.
    - This is the "strategy" where you place general roles on characters. Battle represents tactics and the expression of your build.
- Menus are represented by Souls.
    - Souls are collections of abilities (and stats?) which gives flavor over straight customization
    - Abilities are mix of standard. Users MP ability. And derivation abilities. Which may or may it be MP.
    - Arranging Souls for your character is the basis for customization.
    - You can nest Souls which increase the complexity, nicheness, strength of attacks.
    - Nesting Souls create different abilities that combine traits from each Soul.
        - For example combining nesting Attack and Defend Souls gives you Parry ability
        - Because characters have different base Souls, they're nested Soul Abilities will be different.
            - Keshis interpretation of Leader + Attack is First Strike. Him attacking first in a combo will inspire the others
            - Eji's interpretation is All Strike. Which causes all characters to do a basic Strike.
            - Leader + Sentinel = Guard All
    - You have to nest because Souls have max Four Slots.
    - Emotions which alter menus can lead to Abilities (aka thoughts) you didn't plant in the first place.
- Souls should have some kind of Theming
    - This can be around Mechanics (combo mechanic, casting time, emotions)
- Souls are the primary collectible in the game.
    - Some of them are jokes and do wacky things. You can collect them all at any point. Maybe Keshis soul side quest so you can keep him in your party.

# Level Up Mechanic and Juice
- Battle end causes screen to break into spirits and absorb into Over World Sprite Player
- Overkill damage causes Health Bar to go negative
- It will break into additional spirits giving additional incentive to land big Combo Finishers
- Finishers typically scale
- Finishers are initially introduced as finishers
    - Eventually some are introduced as combo abilities
