- Souls are the primary collectible in the game.
    - Some of them are jokes and do wacky things. You can collect them all at any point. Maybe Keshis soul side quest so you can keep him in your party.
- Leveling Up Ideas
    - New Abilities
    - Additional Slots
    - Additional Nesting Opportunities
    - New Customization
    - More Health, More Stamina, More Magic
- Eji can see enemy thoughts. If he KO's then the enemy menu goes away.
- Battle end causes screen to break into spirits and absorb into Over World Sprite Player
- Overkill damage causes Health Bar to go negative
- It will break into additional spirits giving additional incentive to land big Combo Finishers
- Finishers typically scale
- Finishers are initially introduced as finishers
    - Eventually some are introduced as combo abilities


- finding new areas in sphere grid
- reveals actual sphere, now just circle grid
- cool ideas
	- unexpected links between areas of spheres
	- in final battle they all culminate
- you find spheres in the wild
	- you get back to a campfire and you crack them
	- they unlock stat spheres. big bosses will give whole new constellations
	- there's a guy you talk to later on who talks about duelest soul. he's like dontcha know? there's actually a third stance. your soul unlocks
	- maybe a soul gets destroyed or transformed and you can't access it anymore. 
- plot progression. but still opportunities to grind. I would say the normal game progresses the tree in a way such that you'll never unlock it all unless you grind
- maybe groupings of jobs and you're allowed to express yourself amongst those jobs
- allowing one to grind
- mystery // secrets

- [ ] Research
	- character identity vs clones
	- permanent vs temporary upgrades
	- choice for builds
	- most people say jobs.. giving people different jobs and allowing them to mix and match and lvl up. but there's not much character identity.
	- secrets on the grid
- [ ] AI Research


# Overview
- Progression System will be a graph somewhat similar to sphere grid or chrystarium from Final Fantasy 
- Characters will start in their own central node that contains their unique abilities like Isla's Reciprocity or Eji's Rally. 
- Each character's node will then branch off into other big nodes that represent classes, a collection of abilities, stats, passives, etc. 
	- These Class Nodes can then branch off into a few different directions with a variety of nodes.
		- Stat Nodes representing simple stat ups
		- Ability Nodes granting new abilities to that class menu.
		- Subclass Nodes granting links to a new set of abilities that are typically more niche, more powerful, and more expensive.
			- These subclasses can then again branch off into it's own series
	- Class nodes tie into the combat mechanic where when you're navigating to those abilities you're navigating a menu paths similar to the one you invested into
- Characters are given a set amount of points that increases over the course of the game to invest into different paths
	- These points can be respec-ed at anytime.
- Initially the graph is extremely limited but by enemy drops in the game called Souls can be used at campfires to reveal new insights on the graph (new nodes, or connections)
	- The regular progression of investing into characters gives them more points to invest in graph
	- The meta progression in the game is by defeating enemies to gather their Souls and reveal new areas in the graph
	- There will be a lot of flavor in the connections and reveals between graphs
		- As mentioned characters have their own starting place, and connections to classes will be easier or harder depending on where you start in the graph, perhaps even impossible in some cases, given a limited amount of points to navigate the graph
		- Path will diverge and converge. For example Knight -> Crusader -> Saint is one path that is unlocked fairly early but you had Knight -> Berserker for a while but if you wanted Saint you had to invest in Saint. Then you defeat an enemy who creates a link between Berserker -> Saint. 
		- Early in the game you might unlock a Tier 3 Subclass but no way to access it, leaving the player wondering how to get there.
			- You might talk to someone and it gives some kind of insight
		- Temporarily having someone in your party gives insight on new techniques
		- Party side quests will gives each other access to some of their classes
		- There will be a weird link that is just a long chain of subclasses but don't provide any abilities until the end subclass that provides a pretty cool one. 
			- Shortcut link? let's you easily navigate to it after a while of using it
		- Early in the game you have a Fencer class that switches between stances. Later you meet a fencer master who teaches you about a third stance unlocking a new path in the fencer graph. 
		- There's a rare item in the game that allows you to create a link anywhere
		- A master or rival NPC can “imprint” a path on your graph during a pivotal scene, permanently adding a new branch that feels personal and story-earned.

- Potentially lacking sense of investment
	- Perhaps players can invest spirits into specific class nodes which gives stats?

# equipment ideation
- perhaps there are open nodes where you slot in things? 
- menus but you slot in abilities.. no ties to anything though. Passives?
- some flex spots? Materia vs equipment. 
- Perhaps you lay down a skeleton and can fill the gaps. Changing equipment and armor. Hmm fill out. An equip sword. Fuck I’m cummin. Go down two equip sword paths. And then they’re connected hmm! 
- If you don’t fill out certain things. Maybe requirements. 
- Allow for equipping more items. 

- equipement -  mix, throw, etc
	- materia was applying effects to active effects.
	- applying passives to certain groups of abilities
	- Applying passives to a subset of abilities. Only to tier 1 or 2 or 3. Other materia grant abilities. Hmm so a generic set. It can open up slots for certain kinds of materia. Stat up materia. Or other effects.  Like increased drop rate. Skeleton out in certain ways. 
- Hard to reach tier four abilities and niches. Maybe just one exists.

- use an equipment for auto cast

- equipment in other games... usually stats.


- Binding vows as mods on tree 
	- Only self inflicted pain can break the technique. Conditions for attacks. If you fulfill them the technique unfolds. Making a vow. Then inflicting self main. Unlocks dark knight technique menu.
