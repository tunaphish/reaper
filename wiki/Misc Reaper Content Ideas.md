- [ ] Plot is driven by Mission Structure and not Characters
- [ ] Plot doesn't reflect latest writing
- [ ] Lack of coherent World Building
- [ ] No Character Arcs over course of game. 
	- [ ] Mostly front and backloaded. Revelations should clue you in on the nature of what you are experiencing.

- Cursed technique. If I combine them them..
- the observer
	- looking into sky with arms up as eye rolls to back of head
	- eye observing brain
	- stab eye
	- eye as boss
- You feel the urge to run away
- Hysteria - Blackjack - Lady Luck
- Divine trauma.  My only regret is I couldn’t help more people. 
- Throughout the game. Can you quit with the sharingan. It’s creeping me out. The reveal that you guys are going back in time and watching yourselves
- Intro to new area
- Streaks in the bathroom
- Watching her eat
- Adrenaline
- Flow 
- Motion picture soundtrack. Cuts between crying and living your life normally. Having a cup of coffee
- interruption - don't open the door denji



Keshi is behind the door

- There is no reward
	- You can always change your mind. There’s always time. It’s never too late
	- Meta commentary on games. Locking you out of content. But also progression as the sole source of enjoyment vs
- look sid, theres a man, in the woods



- to love is to eventually lose
	- the heart gets too full. if i am to make place in my heart. to give them the time they deserve. 
	- the heart is too heavy... 
	- just like to push and and to achieve. and to push again. one must love. and lose again. every love is different. there's no replacing. there's only new kinds of love

- what do you remember sei...
	- I remember... it.. all
	- how can these be the most important moments of your life?
	- what do you mean.... isn't it yours?


- To teach Eji how to heal, Sei repeatedly breaks his bones and forces him to heal himself (or greed)
- Flashes back to final fight with Elise. It doesn’t have to be like this. Let me help. You. Let’s fight him together. Glitch. Ash mosaique begins playing. Sei fades in. How. This isn’t possible. You shouldn’t be here. Shut up bitch. Inexplicably wearing a cowboy hat and eyepatch. Elise has no limits. Phase 2 begins. 
- Character points at health bar expanding intro then mogs. 


- Restrictions are reversed  violations cause damage. 
- Reiatsu
- Rock Lee Weights
- give narrative weight to the fights (keshi forces a bet with you and you have to get tattooed a tramp stamp if you lose (you get to design the tramp stamp if he loses lmao))
	- old guy, little health, struggling to fight you. far cry from the warrior he was in the past

- - bro gambled with all his aura

# random content ideas lol

- there was nothing to hear. because I didn't know. these were not lives I've lived. only those i've observed
- The entities ignoring you. Completely uncaring off you. Inspired by the idea of psychedelics actually reducing brain activity, allowing one to be able to perceive what was unperceivable before because you would not be able to operate
- Was born to be the greatest of all time. But he was born at the same time as magnus
- At end of regard quest he dances with wheelchair 
- When my brother died, he had meticulously wrote little notes for my family around his room little uplifting notes. He had birthday cards for everyone's birthday for the next years. He left out presents, even in his last moments he was a giver. Walking in there looked like Christmas, wrapped gifts everywhere.
- If we're not supposed To dance, Why all this music?
	- Sei.. would you dance?

# pokemon poses intro
- First few chapters are like working and shit. 
- Do you know why I am better than you. It’s not because I am richer. It’s because I can kill you. Right here. Right now. 

- Shifts back and forth between the great love. And the great hate alternating as you go deeper. 
	- It shifts back and forth. Even more toxic. If the heights are attained then the gulfs are worth it. 
	- As long as we don’t break up. Then it will all have been worth it. If I can achieve this thing. 
	- He’s someone who climbs mountains
	- He defended her into death. Even when it was her fault. 
	- You assumed throughout that they were toxic to each other. But they always loved each other. 



- narrator explaining jjk abilities
- She’s listening. Do not talk about the incident. 


# Side Missions
- Stories are dumb analogies
	- dumb shit that characters care about
- most stuff in a game should be side missions
- design line for a game should be extremely short

- One day a hawk took a linking to me and we saw each other often. One day the hawk came to me injured so I wrapped his leg in a bandage. After a few days I realized I had not seen the hawk in a while so I went to search for it. I found the bird dead and tangled in a tree. Trapped in makeshift bandage I gave to him. 

- I’ve been waiting for my wife but I can’t find her. Please help me find her, I just need to make sure she’s safe. You find out he died a long time ago. She must have died as well. Help me find her then. She can’t have gone on without me. You find out she moved on and found love again. Already left the world. You never realized because she changed her last name after she remarried.  

# The Final Fetch Quest




# Unsorted
- My time has come.  
	- second place regret

- We have to take him off life support
	- I can’t let you do that. 

- Protect Eji while he performs the execution!
	- The greatest danger. Occurs at the moment of victory. Anger bucks the execution and brings down keshi with him. Reflected Keshi's kill...
- Eren and armor titan in basement. Triggers fight.
- My drill is the drill. Learning from your mentor. 




- lust
- - lust should be a toxic relationship. 
	- I had a bird. That bird would bite other people. But he never bit me. 
	- assumed that she was someone who was stuck in abusive relationship someone who was violent. People would try to help her. 
	- The twist was that she was an evil person actually. The bird analogy is shown and she’s smiling maniacally. 
	- You helped her realize she was a sadist. That life was worth it so she can hurt other people. Lust.  
	- - If you spend too much time thinking. She kisses the menu and it selects an option for you. 
- Lust 
	- Beauty
		- What point is there for in war. Violence for violence sale. No because there’s something to be gained. Honor in battle is staked on the value in other things. But beauty. Beauty is pursued for its own sake. Nothing is more honest. More pure. Then the pursuit of beauty. 
		- Someone who’s been beautiful their whole life. But never taken seriously. The assumption is that she does not like her beauty. However. She loves that she is beautiful. Beauty itself has meaning. 
		- You look at her next to a mirror. And they both start staring at you. You have to fight two of them. In love with each other. 
		- - When I finally saw the sun again. It hurt my eyes. Your shine. Who you are. How you glow. Someone who diminishes who you are. Your parents. Your lover. And finally. Yourself. When you let yourself shine again. Always told to hide yourself. I fear to stain your clothes with blood. If I am vulnerable. The harder I love. The harder I lose. 
		- become softer still: https://www.tiktok.com/@growrotten/video/72290922721204667340
		- stop. give me your hand. I am your friend
			- i fear to stain your clothes with blood
			- stain them. I do not care
		- never got to live true to herself
		- obsessed with beauty. 
		- you died living a lie. 
		- you were always beautiful?

- - Normal everyday things that you appreciate

- the cat cries. the cat cries. he cries. and he cries and he cries and he cries. from morning til evening. from evening til morning. he cries a million times. until one day. he stops crying. and he's motionless. the cat never opened his eyes again.
- Envy
	- Why don’t we play a game eji. See who has less grit. Whoever reaches for their antidote first. Loses.
	- - Envy has a collection. Please.  We have to sell these toy zebra figurines. Why do you care. 
	- 	- maybe envy
		- the battle isn't with others. it's with yourself... the envy is from within. 




# Ava
- Another reaper. Hates Sei. Takes over your allies after Sei leaves
- The mentor tells you the story of her lover. (the goal of arc 2?). Her lover was another mentor of Sei. So she tried to be a reaper. But the first time she reapt a fellow reaper she herself became a lost soul. (side quest? you can go with female mentor to find a lost soul and she knows its weaknesses. she was never able to put her down herself, sei for some reason will not either. but you can do it.) 
	- There's an area you can't Enter. It contains a particularly deadly spirit. Result of Ava. She couldn't take down her friend. As a result she became a lost spirit too difficult to handle. This is her regret. Maybe she moves on after this. 

# The Resistance
Masked hoodlums who want to tear down the reaper establishment. Believes Reapers are a centralized organization that harnesses power and keeps for themselves. They’re People who overcame their emotions but don't want to be apart of the reapers. They take a liking to Eji and want him to join them.

ninja esque, streetwear fashion.  I like Japanese Masks but they're a bit played out at the moment.

Believe disgruntled souls are the result of a shitty society that produces them and are their punishment. Gives incentive for the world to actually give a shit about the people. Embrace chaos. One of the other crew members is a scythe repurposed into a blade.

Teaches you how to take advantage of anger. You should be intolerent of the intolerant. Fuck that fuck you. 

Counter Culture. They go against what is currently in place but they have nothing to offer in return.
