# Ava
- Another reaper. Hates Sei. Takes over your party after Sei leaves
- The mentor tells you the story of her lover. (the goal of arc 2?). Her lover was another mentor of Sei. So she tried to be a reaper. But the first time she reapt a fellow reaper she herself became a lost soul. (side quest? you can go with female mentor to find a lost soul and she knows its weaknesses. she was never able to put her down herself, sei for some reason will not either. but you can do it.) 
	- There's an area you can't Enter. It contains a particularly deadly spirit. Result of Ava. She couldn't take down her friend. As a result she became a lost spirit too difficult to handle. This is her regret. Maybe she moves on after this. 

# The Resistance
Masked hoodlums who want to tear down the reaper establishment. Believes Reapers are a centralized organization that harnesses power and keeps for themselves. Theyâ€™re People who overcame their emotions but don't want to be apart of the reapers. They take a liking to Eji and want him to join them.

ninja esque, streetwear fashion.  I like Japanese Masks but they're a bit played out at the moment.

Believe disgruntled souls are the result of a shitty society that produces them and are their punishment. Gives incentive for the world to actually give a shit about the people. Embrace chaos. One of the other crew members is a scythe repurposed into a blade.

Teaches you how to take advantage of anger. You should be intolerent of the intolerant. Fuck that fuck you. 

Counter Culture. They go against what is currently in place but they have nothing to offer in return.
