# Sound Design
- The music in the background of you taking to a character. He tells you to shut up and the music and his voice play over  game sounds and your voice. Probably when Keshi is turning
- Music playing through the door. Open up and the battle starts and the music blasts. It happens on continues. 
- Approaching the boss battle. It’s muffled like you’re at a party. Retry and it picks back up
- Sideline characters chime in while you fight. 
	- some are procedural. “Hayai” while others are narrative. 
- ASMR?
- Lighter sounds. Drop some fire tracks like mf Lil Wayne. All his attacks are preempted by light. Chick chik, FLEHHGHGHGHGHHH. 
- Mourning Doves
- Lighting Bugs
- Different characters have different sound triggers for magic. 
	- Like one was the lighter. 
	- Another one is cocking of a gun?  
	- camera sounds 
- - Heavy base song shakes the UI. 
- Lightsaber sound
- Japanese Bow Sounds
- Muffled Sounds
- Kingdom Hearts sound effects
- Naruto sound 
- Spider-Man sound
- - Crack open can for meal
- Chainsaw noises. 
- Dialogue has priority so story related or other UX things can be conveyed. Magic being cancelled is one example. 
	- One guy has the power to delay audio queues. Characters will acknowledge this in universe. Conversations will be more delayed due to the sound trick. 
# Incidental Dialogue
- Game catches you grinding. Y’all just chat during battle. 
- Cutscenes play while you're doing upgrades at bonfires.

	- The duplicate is revealed by their shadow 
	- Duplicates run in three different directions. Have to pick the character you follow. Follow all three. 
- Back to front dynamic camera movement with depth.

- YOMI Hustle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGqAA5XllvE
- Changing Pitch as you get deeper into menu..
	- giving gamey effects like knockback, impact, destruction upon selection
- Hand drawn art trade offs are multiplicative for animation. color x frame.

	- when someone dies animation
- UX visual hierachy to distract during menu design (size, color, weight, movement)
