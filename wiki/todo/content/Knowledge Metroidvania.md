Whenever possible gate progression SOFTLY via knowledge. This greatly increases player agency.

# Examples
- In game lore changes due to forgetting about a certain character 
- Contextual options are given in shop. 
	- Shopping with Elise instead offers discounts at the Witch's shop. 
	- You can seduce the waitress. 
- Return time and time again to central NPC with new conversation options. 
- Don't go into XXX area, there's an extremely strong spirit who will kill you.
- Certain mirrors allow fast travel once you learn the interaction
- Characters are weak against certain items 
- [[adriana and her birds]]: her birds are in the background. Tapping it away lets a character talk more freely. 
- DO NOT DRINK THE WATER
- Let player's stumble upon a hidden area
- Unlocked lore appears in loading screens
- You can reap random souls. Hidden bosses. Souls teach you how to feel. Give new attacks.



- Pretends to be infinite loop. So you rush through it. Only to be presented with the end. There was no loop. You’re rushing to your own death. 
	- Force you to interact with battle system in different way. Stamina slow down means you have to do bursts of activities. Generally enemies suffer from same thing?  Empathy. 
	- Or you can ignore emotions and W key to victory. Hard mode requires additional hurdles. All just for thanks. Maybe you get same reward either way. Mask of a friend versus mask of an enemy
	- The illusion of emotion versus thought. Like the illusion of body versus mind. 
- Have you heard the bell in a while?
- Take his soul and get abilities
	- Equivilent exchange. Offer yourself to res. The world operates on laws. 
	- Something I’ve never done before. Lead up. Newscast. I don't remember giving this newscast before
- Dopplegangers....
- Characters have different triggers...
	- Damage yourself under certain circumstances
- Exploration Rewards
	- Easter Eggs
	- Hidden Stories
	- Audio Logs
	- And if we're doing treasure, either make it unique, or make it in a currency that's a) rare enough and b) contributes to unlocking actual meaningful upgades. You can do both. A secret stash in Dishonored is likely to yield you a rune or a trinket, a fragment of a diary and some environmental storytelling explaining why those items are there. Were they stolen by a rogue witch-hunter or is this ransacked apartment secretly a cultist's abode? Going off the beaten path in New Vegas would lead you to whole new locations, quests and stories, but not everyone
	- You have, by accident, discovered the magic that can be a well balanced game economy. It is usually rare, because devs rarely dare to put players into tight spots.

- Conflicting Information that is both true and not true at the same time
	- Conflict in characters trying to resolve themselves
	- Have you seen this man in your dreams

- Sincerity in the face of absurdism. Undertake world. They don’t take anything seriously. And they make fun of you.  A jokester. Sincerity in the face of a world that doesn’t care.

- Everyone’s fighting the same guy. 
	- The business man and the family man. 
	- All same guy
- Game Mechanic - Lighting
	- Game is naturally lit by city. Lightning. Vending machines. Attracts players to lit areas. Spell Idea. Light ball.
- The different silent hill camera angles. 
- Add early in game ways to break the game. Expensive weapons in store you can’t afford. A hidden mega boss that gives strong weapons. 
- Vantage Points, Spiral Design, Cleverly Disguised Linear Paths, Forward Progress
- named signature moves. Like mikiri counter. You have a good ass soul from the beginning of the game that carries you. Legendary reaper. Mothers kiss. You finally meet the person who invented it and owns 
- Covenant of clarity. Unlocks passives. Unlocks letting you resonate with enemies. Or see their decisions. Etc. 
- Aerith house made me want a cozy house
- Men chase the cat. Twist is you have to befriend the cat.
- indoctrination
- mafia guy who used pizza place as front but got too popular and just did pizza full time
	- throughout the game the guy moves on and drops his criminal ways. but the pizza still takes a long time because of the long lines
- You go into a flashback training arc. You do the move a bunch of times. You prep to do the move to the boss in you flashback and it current boss fight before you got kicked into the flashback
- diagetic music sound ramps up when you enter building. Dies down as you leave. Song from bathroom.
