- Blackout, Psychogenesis

- Tap everyone to fight to begin channeling aura
- Someone teaches you a technique to always have it up so you aren’t ambushed. Like a fucking anime. 
	- Don’t want to teach them how to always have running. I like the tension building of accumulating aura. Psycho genesis 
	- She’s the bomb devil! Boom fight starts 
- Initial talk phase. You have to trick them into letting you get close. This alerts them and then they start accumulating aura. 
	- perhaps you get to know them

- Content
	- There’s a fight where someone doesn’t want to fight you. But they’re cornered. Or you suspect someone or some shit. When all of a sudden. You see their health box start storing aura. Keshi starts in response. Then he yells at you to start accumulating aura. -
		- Maybe this is the intro to the female character and the first time you see someone start accumulating mana from dialogue window.
