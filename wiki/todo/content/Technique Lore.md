- Techniques have conditions to fulfill. If you fulfill they go away. You try not to fulfill them. 
- Fucking covenants. They’re a form of technique. Laws I follow. I grant haste but hitting max AP means you lose technique. 
	- Techniques typically trade. Law of equivalent exchange - Power for defense. But I made it so I can change when that is. 
- In order for technique to work you have to explain it. 

- Examples
	- Don’t let it hit MAX AP. The desire to efficiently use AP. Hitting max AP means that you are not efficiently using AP. Therefore you are not acting efficiently. Techniques are desire. Efficacy. They intentionally don’t achieve desires. This is the basis for techniques
	- Flash step. No animation even plays. Player just starts taking damage lmao.
