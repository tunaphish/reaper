- Spirits are Souls are left behind when they die with regrets. Reapers come to excise these souls by beheading them. Souls are stronger and more dangerous the more regretful they are.
- Reapers are also dead
- Reaping souls require that you depress them first 
- Usually people who kill themselves don’t become a Reaper
- when you become a reaper you forget the reason you feel the way you do. all you have left are your emotions but you don't remember why. eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions and thus your regret. responsibilities being an allegory for passion or purpose in life. there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? or is it just being left to others.n't remember why. eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions and thus your regret. responsibilities being an allegory for passion or purpose in life. there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? or is it just being left to others.
