# Aesthetics Feelings
- Nostalgia
	- - you can never step into the same river again. For they are different waters. And you. You are a different man.
- Halloween. The cuteness. But the legitimate fear around that time with the scary movies. 

# Eerie Atmospheres
- things aren't right:
- normal to make eye contact https://www.tiktok.com/@susitse.art/video/7239852404823313691
- - look over the distance. and see the floor, the skyscrapers plumed on floor clouds. going through that area in all it's obscurity. you can't see where you are going. you don't know how to enter. a result of entities.
	- the god like entities in chained echoes that determine life. that you have to just work around
	- - Following a signs instructions. Disney land. The environment. The fear. The rules of a land. Do not look a monster in the eye. 

- Signs of something having recently been there. A still warm camp ground. 
- Long quiet somber moments after someone has died. You have to travel along the train tracks. 
- You sneak into a basement. The door is audible. Walking down steps is audible. You find a secret. Then you hear the door. The steps. You hide. The grandma immediately runs up to you immediately initiates battle and immediately inflicts Petrify.
- You have to fight through the dark forest. To get to the end. The battle music doesn’t stop. Constant fights. 
- The wind blowing the grass really hard. 

- DELIVER THE AESTHETIC FIRST. THE FEELING. THE MELANCHOLLYYY
	- Expressions. Art. I want very basic art for environment. I want dynamic lighting
	- For the display art. I want anime art? With ghibli esque density. But omocat basic
- Mission Structure
	- Characters talking and planning. Discussing the world. Intra allies discussions. Inns. Fireplaces. Coffee shop…. Fuck. What was happening in the world. Why it’s weird. 
	- - towns are the dungeon. that feeling of arriving in a town and seeing the mini cutscene of the stuff going on with a lil image to go with it
	- after you arrive at a town you characters search for a place with coffee
	- experiences ideas
		- Dense fog forest. Spirits waiting for you. Following flames only for one to be an encounter. Mysterious lore. Don’t follow the lights in the dense forest. Or in the green house. Maybe some other urban kind of environment. Guck it I like green houses. Figure out why later. 
		- - strong lighting... RV's
		- Entity is following you in game. But you can’t approach. Or it’s always disappearing. 
		- Wake from this nightmare. sTAB
	- - surreality. a place that exists inside but doesn't exist outside 
		- look for a room that shouldn't exist
- the fucking trailer homes diarama lighting from museum of jurassic technology
	- greed's hometown
