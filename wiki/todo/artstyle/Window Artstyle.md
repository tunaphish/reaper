- Window similar to announcing attack announcing attacks in anime?
	- make it bold and shit and have special effects
- Menus close one at a time instead of at once.
- By stacking layers, you can add a ton of depth to environments and even interface elements. One of my personal favorites is to add a nearly-transparent "dust layer" that mostly just drifts about, but responds to nearby movement and/or u interactions.



- spawn a bunch of attacks
- spawn a bunch of swords
- character talks over another character
- spawn eyes, reactions
- spawn additional enemies
