# Eji's Backstory
- Prologue: Sei and Eji
	- pretend like you don't know anything ye
	- he's optimistic. he's happy go lucky. he's the classic shounen protagonist. simple dreams. 
	- revelation that reapers are also dead
- Mission 2: Purposes
	- He meets the team. discuss dead reapers. how they also stayed behind for a purpose. girl reveals her purpose. it's something grand and beautiful. maybe about her family. she wanted to make sure they continued living well. keshi is a bit more guarded about his. he divulges little detail on it but implies that it consumes him and powers him. they move onto eji... and leaning into stereotypical JRPG tropes... he doesn't remember. Not remembering your past is somewhat common for lost souls but not remembering your purpose is rare given that a condition for not moving onto the afterlife. 
	- This sets off the main desire line for eji. To seek his purpose. Every battle he seeks to understand who they were. Their purpose. To see what they feel. And see what resonated within him. 
- Mission 7: Sei's Past. 
	- in the final mission I talked to you about meeting sei and discussing his past and his target. very little information is given. sei doesn't seem to remember much about his past either and is still shrouded in ambiguity. this promps eji to start an investigation to learn more about sei's past. 
		- Sei... joins your allies. 
	- you go through the dungeon and start investigating his past. 
		- you look into his job. the dungeon. there's a dickhead boss. annoying coworkers. but overall a normal office job
		- you go into his family home. normal parents. normal siblings. 
		- you go deeper into him. and you find nothing at all. 
		- conversation with sei beigns 
	- I've been here a long time eji.
	- Longer... longer than I can even remember 
	- any remnants of my past... they're been gone for a long tim enow. 
	- we weren't viewing my past. we were viewing yours. you didn't forgot your purpose. you never had one. a miserly. pointless. repetitive life. there was nothing to remember. because there was nothing worth remembering.
		- in a way his lack of purpose became his purpose. leaving behind his life having done nothing. just living idly day by day. the irony and revelation is that there was no grand revelation. he was just a simple person who had no grand purpose or story. 
- You have to steel your heart. Because the road ends for everybody one day. But that road must start for another. And if you don't steel your heart. Your road will never end. But theirs will never have to start. 


- I’ve been watching you. The morbid curiosity. Desperate to participate. But you can’t. You can only watch. You can only experience vicariously what comes to others so naturally. Because that is your nature. You lived their lives. But. Every time time. Every life. Without fail. You felt it. That feeling that’s always there. Nothing. No matter what you do. What life you live. You will always be that way. 

- Even when you feel nothing. Don’t you feel it so deeply. 
	- to push down. To carry on. That wasn’t your weakness. It was your strength. It’s what lead you to me. 
- Tracing it all the way back. The seminal moment for eji. He wanted to do something. And then his friends called it cringe. So he never did it again. But this is the ramifications it had on his life. Becoming a sheltered person. Everyone laments that his core is so shallow when they find out. I guess as a peace of lore when reapers ascend they find out the memories of others too.
