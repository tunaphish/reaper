# Mission 2 - Nostalgia 

- the Training arc
- meet the team. Keshi and Elise
		- Exchange purposes. Find out eji doesn't have one. Weird
 - reapers also have regrets that caused them to stay behind (revealed by the Keshi)
	- Eji does not have a purpose he knows of. They conclude he has amnesia. 
- however, they also wield some sense of control over their emotions 
- sei: lost souls are different because they have no rationality. they blurt whatever comes to mind based on what they're feeling. we, reapers, despite some of us having the same emotional sway can pick and choose. 
- The family man and the business man. No matter what you do. You're bound to 
- Twins: confused as to why you keep meeting the same guy but he's different. Maybe you think they were different parts of the same personality. 


Your character is leaving home, his friends, to go work where he's needed. There's more regret in the city.

> The city is where people go to chase their dreams. And with chasing your dreams comes the dissapointment. The regret.


- regret doing the risky thing vs the not risky thing. I should've joined that startup and followed my dream. instead I worked for megaco and died a slave.
- deals heavily with nostalgia
- tries to return to when he was a kid. there's lots of videogame tropes that get established here. 
- the final battle is in a vacuum of white walls. the thing I fought so hard to get. 

sei: I remember that company... it never even took off.
eji: It's not about whether it took off. It's about doing it. Knowing that you gave it your all..

like PT but instead of a traditional horror it's more of a surrealist existential horror. I'm going to do the same everything, everyday for the rest of my life until I die. is this what life is? you repeatedly go down the same hallway fighting the same enemies go through their life. at the end is the boss.. the regret on their death bed. each time you go through the hallway you have to figure out how it's changed?

	- HEAVENLY KEY - Apollo Rocky training vibes
	- second place. always climbing to the top. it's you and greed.
