- Can I seriously just skate as long as possible? In a system that’s corrupt on multiple levels. Prashanti is a senior and she’s not good at her job. This system. Doesn’t know shit. And I’m expected to full throat it? Fuck this. Fuck you. 
	- Also my wife thinks I’m retarded. Telling me what I already know. Do I know? And I retarded?
	- It’s their job to exploit them. And it’s mine to exploit them
	- I wonder if she thought I wasn’t capable of creating beautiful things. Things that could make one cry. Things that actually touched one’s soul. I wonder if she thinks me crass. Just another dirty fool. A bit of me thinks he doesn’t see me that way.
	- I used to be an artist, someone she wanted to dive further into. But she doesn't see me that way anymore. just someone who goes into work. no depth. hmm. 
	- She has these thoughts that he’s just an incompetent husband. One for him to have money be spent. He noticed all the things to fall in love with her over. But she never did. He’s still a boy. A boy in the the superficial ways that a boy is a boy. He ate steaks. Big ones. Drank beers with his boys. Made crude jokes. 
	- Late at night he would talk with his boys. They’d vent in deep ways. I’m not meant to just be a wallet. I just love her. Even if she doesn’t love me in that same way. One day she will. That’s what those friendships meant to me. Because they saw that I was capable of more. Had something to offer. Something profound. Are you serious? I’ve been having those thoughts since I was a little girl.
