- Combat Goals
	- Use lots of different tools during battle (interesting choices)
	- Increasing Tension during Battle
	- Rule of Cool

## Classes 
- Lots of JRPG Skill Expression comes from customization and preparing your units for battle rather then the battle itself where players can mathematically arrive at the 'correct' answer and use reactive abilities to heal when necessary.
    - This is the "strategy" where you place general roles on characters. Battle represents tactics and the expression of your build.
- classes should be extremely distinct. they're distinguished by comparison to other classes.
    - what classes CANNOT do
---
- Menus are represented by Souls.
    - Souls are collections of abilities  which gives flavor over straight customization
    - Arranging Souls for your character is the basis for customization.
    - You can nest Souls which increase the complexity, nicheness, strength of attacks.
    - Nesting Souls create different abilities that combine traits from each Soul.
- Souls have max Four Slots.
- Souls have some kind of Theming around Mechanics (combo mechanic, casting time, emotions)
- Action Traits
	- Buffs/Debuffs 
	- Criteria attack
	- Scaling
	- Restrictions
	- Ultimates
		- Difficult Criteria
		- High Cost
	- Rethink Triggers
- targeting an enemy causes them to go airborne
	- attacking an airborne enemy causes them to go higher
	- some actions have an effect on airborne enemies
- action - niche  
- adverb - medium, interesting to pair effects
- passive - general, low strength
	- Passives in general should not effect all abilities in a flat way, it should change what options you want to take as a player
	- example buffs adding flat damage which makes multi hits stronger
