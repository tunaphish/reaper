# Mission 3 - The Hikikomori
- Gluttony?
- Reapers are rare. the type of person who feels strongly but is still able to operate and continue on. 
- Some Strong Lost Souls Are Reapers
- the nostalgia. when you are under your father's protection. having fun as a kid. eji is someone who feels. and feels strongly. in the beginning you are taught to stifle these things. eventually you find yourself numb in chapter 3. you can feel those things. enjoy those things. because you had someone protecting you. 
	- what would you do when violence be performed on you? you were there with keshi. and you were powerless to stop it. 
	- the range must exist from the beginning. a kind of flow state. (lucky conversation) you got lucky eji. that I was here and you were under my protection.


A character who stays inside. Who lives his life on his computer. It's going to start out trite. With the obvious lesson that he died with regrets because he lived his life in front of a computer.

However, as you go through it you realize that the computer is a place of solace. A place where he found others to connect with. A place where he belonged.

This the part of the Knowledge Metroidvania where you can get to know characters and learn how to lay them to rest properly. In the first two missions Sei is generally right. His takes on how to take down Souls is efficient and works quickly. However, you realize that there should be another way. The end of mission 2 starts that conflict.

"how can I learn about him when he won't let us open the door..." There's a huge barrier between you and the doors. You go around the large house and learn more about him, cleaning up souls here and there. The place is a mansion yet they still produced a hikikomori. Sei assumes the parents did something and he's right. Put a fair amount of pressure on the lad.


- Doppleganger is envy. If this attack kills, restore MP. Lowered attack
	- Nostalgia with friend group. Establishes friend group. Enemy right before Greed.
