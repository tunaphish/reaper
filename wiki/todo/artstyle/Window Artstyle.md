# Mind Dump
- Window similar to announcing attack announcing attacks in anime?
	- make it bold and shit and have special effects
- Menus close one at a time instead of at once.
- By stacking layers, you can add a ton of depth to environments and even interface elements. One of my personal favorites is to add a nearly-transparent "dust layer" that mostly just drifts about, but responds to nearby movement and/or u interactions.


## Content Ideas
- spawn a bunch of attacks
	- spawn a bunch of swords
- character talks over another character
- spawn eyes, reactions
- spawn additional enemies
- She’s lying 
- Fractured self effect
- Only a text box
	- … oh. I guess. I’ve disappeared now. 
- Shows all the gifs of your past life. Do you want to forget? Yes. No. 
	- They all fade one by one 
- Pop ups and modals
- Window fractals
- Her hair. Her eyes. Her plump lips. Error. Error. Error. Error. 

## Issues
- character dancing
- new displays
- fitting everythang

- probably lots of cool ideas to be had with regard to my other abilities...
- rewrite my game AGAIN.. probably punt it back all the way to 2D assets... and remove a shit ton of assets. focus on dialogue now..


# Implementation
- let's just focus on  dialogue for now
	- okay so it needs 
	- width, height, depth (or maybe a way to do it organically?)
	- x, y coordinates
	- styled in different ways.. perhaps a type 
		- dialogue 
		- choice...
		- animation... plus
	- params based on the type of window it is... does it make sense to do this in some kind of DSL language? I would need an interpreter lmao. maybe each piece of dialogue is custom... but I don't necessarily want to do that. 
	- choices oftentimes always appear in a certain place... along with dialogue 
	- perhaps it's optional with a set of smart defaults. bottom left... bottom right. stuff like that
