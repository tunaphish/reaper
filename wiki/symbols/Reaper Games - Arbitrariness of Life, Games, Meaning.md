Gamble: Play a game of luck that greatly influences the battle 
- Games don't really have a point, there's no meaning beyond the game. They're arbitrary rules. 
- But life is also arbitrary. What you decide the meaning is. What goals you define. Life is a game at the end of the day.
- Sei's decision to play the game and change his mind shows his change of heart at the end of the game. 

[[Mission 1 - Intro]]
- Sei: Never play games or hint at the possibility, we have to play them.
- Eji: Why?
- Sei: They're a complete waste of time. Arbitrary rules and goals grounded in luck. They're a waste of life 
- Eji: Let's play a round.

[[Mission 3 - The Hikikomori]]
- Elise: I love games. Let's play rock, paper scissors. 
- Eji: He always throws rock. 
- Elise: Why?
- Eji: It's his little way of protesting playing games. 


- Elise: If Sei is stubborn like a rock, maybe I'll always do scissors
- Keshi: Why...  you'd always lose to Sei
- Elise: Scissors are kind of like our scythes right? Just put two of them together
- Sei: That's... an interesting way of looking at it 

[[Mission 7 - Generations]]
- Sei: Why don't we play a game of rock, paper, scissors
- Eji: Why? 
- Eji: You hate games
- Sei: Well, if we're going to waste time, why not have a little fun
**You play until you throw scissors. Sei finally changes his move to paper.
The screen to reap appears. **

- - Keshi is always playing games. Who does more damage. Game superficially keeps count. Rock paper scissors. It’s all the strength he had to play in bed with his mom. 

- - -
- Keshi's Special Ability - Wager
	- Adds Jankenbo Menu to Attacks
	- Winning does double damage, failing does zero
	- Enemies will have predictable behavior that align with their AI 
		- Keshi alludes to this
		- Gives players chance to do increased damage 
		- Eji's Perfect Sight let's him predict the attack. Keshi admonishes you for this though.
		- keshi challnges sei to rock paper scissors one last time during his death. You go to open up his menu and it’s all rock. He will never change. 
		- Some examples
			- AI will always do the same. 
			- AI will cycle through throws.
			- AI will use whatever will beat the last hand you threw
			- AI will not use last thrown (making it a 50-50)
			- AI will use the same hand til they lose.


# Absurdism and Arbitrary Meaning
- Absurdism. Strange shit is going on but all you care about is your dumb shit. Meaning is applied.
