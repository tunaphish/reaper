- [ ] Ideate Overworld Artstyle -> 
- [ ] relate this to vision
- [ ] relate this to other world building

# Inspiration 
- Omori -> Strong color pallete Pixel Art 2D Overworld. hand Drawn Battle system
- Ghibli Films -> Density of environments. Appeals to Children and Adults. Beautiful environments
- TWEWY -> Game taking place across a city

# Environment 
- Takes place across city. Opens up as it progresses and allows revisiting areas you've already been to. 
- Pixel Art 
- Dappled lighting in game


## Artificial Environments
artificial recreations of nature is a theme I like
- Aquarium
- Long hallway with a single statue standing in the middle of it (Ghibli Museum Inspiration)
- Green house
- plant shop
- A location in game is a huge college campus with sprawling park
- There’s a statue hidden in the corner. It has a spirit there. 
- Lots of hidden secrets

# Aesthetics Feelings
- Nostalgia
	- - you can never step into the same river again. For they are different waters. And you. You are a different man.
- Halloween. The cuteness. But the legitimate fear around that time with the scary movies. 

# Eerie Atmospheres
- things aren't right:
- normal to make eye contact https://www.tiktok.com/@susitse.art/video/7239852404823313691
- - look over the distance. and see the floor, the skyscrapers plumed on floor clouds. going through that area in all it's obscurity. you can't see where you are going. you don't know how to enter. a result of entities.
	- the god like entities in chained echoes that determine life. that you have to just work around
	- - Following a signs instructions. Disney land. The environment. The fear. The rules of a land. Do not look a monster in the eye. 

- Signs of something having recently been there. A still warm camp ground. 
- Long quiet somber moments after someone has died. You have to travel along the train tracks. 
- You sneak into a basement. The door is audible. Walking down steps is audible. You find a secret. Then you hear the door. The steps. You hide. The grandma immediately runs up to you immediately initiates battle and immediately inflicts Petrify.
- You have to fight through the dark forest. To get to the end. The battle music doesn’t stop. Constant fights. 
- The wind blowing the grass really hard. 

- DELIVER THE AESTHETIC FIRST. THE FEELING. THE MELANCHOLLYYY
	- Expressions. Art. I want very basic art for environment. I want dynamic lighting
	- For the display art. I want anime art? With ghibli esque density. But omocat basic
- Mission Structure
	- Characters talking and planning. Discussing the world. Intra party discussions. Inns. Fireplaces. Coffee shop…. Fuck. What was happening in the world. Why it’s weird. 
	- - towns are the dungeon. that feeling of arriving in a town and seeing the mini cutscene of the stuff going on with a lil image to go with it
	- after you arrive at a town you characters search for a place with coffee
	- experiences ideas
		- Dense fog forest. Spirits waiting for you. Following flames only for one to be an encounter. Mysterious lore. Don’t follow the lights in the dense forest. Or in the green house. Maybe some other urban kind of environment. Guck it I like green houses. Figure out why later. 
		- - strong lighting... RV's
		- Entity is following you in game. But you can’t approach. Or it’s always disappearing. 
		- Wake from this nightmare. sTAB
	- - surreality. a place that exists inside but doesn't exist outside 
		- look for a room that shouldn't exist
- the fucking trailer homes diarama lighting from museum of jurassic technology
	- greed's hometown


# Knowledge Metroidvania
- [ ] relate to vision
- [ ] relate to other gameplay
- [ ] Rewards
	- [ ] get souls return to village and interact with NPCs to buy equipment, upgrade level or buy items

Players are encouraged to interact with everything because learning about the world influences gameplay. Learning new things about characters, gaining new abilities via conversing with NPCs and such allow you to find new things about progress to new areas. 

Whenever possible gate progression SOFTLY via knowledge. This greatly increases player agency. 
"I always could have done it but didn't understand the world well enough".

# Gameplay 
- Talk to NPCs
- Investigate environments 
- Read Item Descriptions
- Investigate Homes and Surrounding Areas
- Investigated areas with no new info are dimmed

- Unlocks new abilities 
- FInd out where spirit is
- Find out that a strong spirit (that you skip fighting) is your target
- Find boss weak points
- Find out reaper lore

# Examples
- In game lore changes due to forgetting about a certain character 
- Contextual options are given in shop. 
	- Shopping with Elise instead offers discounts at the Witch's shop. 
	- You can seduce the waitress. 
- Return time and time again to central NPC with new conversation options. 
- Don't go into XXX area, there's an extremely strong spirit who will kill you.
- Certain mirrors allow fast travel once you learn the interaction
- Characters are weak against certain items 
- [[adriana and her birds]]: her birds are in the background. Tapping it away lets a character talk more freely. 
- DO NOT DRINK THE WATER
- Let player's stumble upon a hidden area
- Unlocked lore appears in loading screens
- You can reap random souls. Hidden bosses. Souls teach you how to feel. Give new attacks.



- Pretends to be infinite loop. So you rush through it. Only to be presented with the end. There was no loop. You’re rushing to your own death. 
	- Force you to interact with battle system in different way. Stamina slow down means you have to do bursts of activities. Generally enemies suffer from same thing?  Empathy. 
	- Or you can ignore emotions and W key to victory. Hard mode requires additional hurdles. All just for thanks. Maybe you get same reward either way. Mask of a friend versus mask of an enemy
	- The illusion of emotion versus thought. Like the illusion of body versus mind. 
- Have you heard the bell in a while?
- Take his soul and get abilities
	- Equivilent exchange. Offer yourself to res. The world operates on laws. 
	- Something I’ve never done before. Lead up. Newscast. I don't remember giving this newscast before
- Dopplegangers....
- Characters have different triggers...
	- Damage yourself under certain circumstances
- Exploration Rewards
	- Easter Eggs
	- Hidden Stories
	- Audio Logs
	- And if we're doing treasure, either make it unique, or make it in a currency that's a) rare enough and b) contributes to unlocking actual meaningful upgades. You can do both. A secret stash in Dishonored is likely to yield you a rune or a trinket, a fragment of a diary and some environmental storytelling explaining why those items are there. Were they stolen by a rogue witch-hunter or is this ransacked apartment secretly a cultist's abode? Going off the beaten path in New Vegas would lead you to whole new locations, quests and stories, but not everyone
	- You have, by accident, discovered the magic that can be a well balanced game economy. It is usually rare, because devs rarely dare to put players into tight spots.

- Conflicting Information that is both true and not true at the same time
	- Conflict in characters trying to resolve themselves
	- Have you seen this man in your dreams

- Sincerity in the face of absurdism. Undertake world. They don’t take anything seriously. And they make fun of you.  A jokester. Sincerity in the face of a world that doesn’t care.

- Everyone’s fighting the same guy. 
	- The business man and the family man. 
	- All same guy
- Game Mechanic - Lighting
	- Game is naturally lit by city. Lightning. Vending machines. Attracts players to lit areas. Spell Idea. Light ball.
- The different silent hill camera angles. 
- Add early in game ways to break the game. Expensive weapons in store you can’t afford. A hidden mega boss that gives strong weapons. 
- Vantage Points, Spiral Design, Cleverly Disguised Linear Paths, Forward Progress
- named signature moves. Like mikiri counter. You have a good ass soul from the beginning of the game that carries you. Legendary reaper. Mothers kiss. You finally meet the person who invented it and owns 
- Covenant of clarity. Unlocks passives. Unlocks letting you resonate with enemies. Or see their decisions. Etc. 
- Aerith house made me want a cozy house
- Men chase the cat. Twist is you have to befriend the cat.
- indoctrination
- mafia guy who used pizza place as front but got too popular and just did pizza full time
	- throughout the game the guy moves on and drops his criminal ways. but the pizza still takes a long time because of the long lines
- You go into a flashback training arc. You do the move a bunch of times. You prep to do the move to the boss in you flashback and it current boss fight before you got kicked into the flashback
- diagetic music sound ramps up when you enter building. Dies down as you leave. Song from bathroom. 


# Analog Horror
- Contradiction. You need to find contradictions in their world view. Triggers things. 
- Did you notice that? Rules aren’t working. A distortion. 
	- Things that never happen but you don’t realize
	- Toilet paper is upside down 
	- Social aversion. Only one chair for big space 
- crickets at night
	- someone visiting at night
	- you constantly hear about greed and the shit he did throughout his life
	- you never know it's the old man. he's the best of the boomers
