Slow summer eve
Every person you meet has moments they will leave you on the floor weeping

Eji. Your soul changes. Oftentimes in unexpected ways. Soul dog plants. Of animals. Your more sensitive then most. You feel what other feel. You think about what others think. That’s what makes you special. But that’s also what makes you shield your heart. 
Eji. Don’t forget. You change others souls too 

How will you change it?

Heaven. Hell. Reincarnation

Souls are connected. 
Mom. She’s hurting. 

Eji always plays with dogs 
Dogs have souls too ya know. 
Dogs will be dogs. People will be people. 
From POV of dog
Ejis dog was waiting for him. By the grave
They both do
They rile up their dogs 
They’re too old

The same observant and emphatic ness prevents him from being open. Intellectualizing. Watching. Is not the same thing as feeling. An observer to life. Is the major thing he needs to overcome
