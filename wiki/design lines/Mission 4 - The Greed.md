> Fall Seven Times, Get up Eight

- The previous revelation is that you are hunting Reapers who've become Lost Souls.
	- Characters are struggling with this revelation. He's the one who inspires you to keep trying. To figure out what it is that you need to figure out. 
	- To be the top no matter what it takes. 
	- Eji's lesson in particular is the burden of leadership. As the strongest. To pick a direction for his team that they can follow. Even when... especially when he himself doesn't know where he's going. The pit.
- Up until this point, Bosses had built up to 3 phases. Greed has EIGHT.
	- Sixth ranger, who's abscense makes the heart grow fonder
		- Bro walked off like he knew I needed his help (i did)
	- Maybe he's helping you up until this point.
	- You are fighting [[The Spiritless]]. He expends health bars helping you?

- Phase 1 - Standard
	- Starts out with your characters in a pit. It's filled to the brim with other humans. As you make the climb out the pit with Greed you can see other humans fall. He helps you with him. 
	- Not sure why he struggled at this point.
- Phase 2 - Standard
	- Find an Ultra Health Potion at some point. 
- Phase 3 - Revelation
	- Steals your Ultra Health Potion
		- Refills All 3 of his life bars. 
		- WHATEVER IT TAKES
			- Telling everybody to try isn't that everyone will succeed. it's that one will.. and all you need is that one. 
			- If a hundred will succeed. I will be one of them.
			- If one succeeds. I will be that one.
			- If nobody succeeds. Then you will know I have died trying. 
			- I am the one who wants for all. I am the one who reaches. I am...
- Phase 4 - 5
	- Another series of fights. 
	- I've always wanted to climb to the peak. I always climbed higher. higher. HIGHER. When I finally reached the peak. I didn't get to look at everyone I climbed over. I didn't get to see how high I was. No. I looked up. Even higher. Higher then I could ever hope to crane my neck. There was another mountain. Far higher then the peak I just ascended. I didn't see it before. I couldn't have. The mountain I was climbing was blocking the way. Only by getting to the top could I see how futile my efforts were. 
		- Climbing out of the hole is easy in a way. The only direction to go is up. Stfu. Lift. But once you’re out. You look in every direction and there’s and infinite plane stretching. I can go anywhere I want. But where the fuck do I want to go. And more then that. How can I expect someone to follow me when I don’t know. 
		- That’s the burden of leadership. Of responsibility. No one knows where to go. You just gotta pick a direction and move. You might find yourself going the wrong way. But trust yourself that you will eventually find the way. 
		- there’s another nagging feeling though. What if I walk all this distance. Only to realize. I’m in another larger hole. 
- Phase 6
	- You defeat his six health bar. Here's the decisions where you can validate his emotions. How he lived his life
	- Option 1 (ignore):
		- It was all worthless. You never reached the top 
	- Option 2 (empathy): The Sigma Grindset -> Grew up poor. An athelete. Who was always searching for the finish line. Your partner always wanted to be the best. He got gold. Always tried hard. Always reached. But did I ever reach the place I was reaching for. 
		- "I see. There was never a finish line... "
		- It was never about reaching the end huh. Here I am and what I have to show for it.
		- It was always about the struggle. It was about those moments. It was about the desire. It was about...
		- The GREED. 
		- Now. Show me. Show me your ego. Show me. Your greed.
		- - Greed's allegory. he always wanted more. always striving for the top. 
		- ​That’s it. More. More. Every mile. Every yard. Every foot. Every inch. As far as you can. 
			- never reached his goal
- Phase 7 
	- 
- Phase 8 
	- Health finally wittles down. He gets the fuck back up.
	- He roars. Everyone's in shock. Up until this point characters would let you reap them. But Greed continues to fight even unconscious. You have to defend Eji while greed pelts you with attacks. 
	- FALL SEVEN TIMES. GET UP EIGHT.

# Fight Ideas
- Any attack that doesn’t increase over the last attack suffers from anger. Or they don’t count
	- (Buffs increase in importance. You learn to stack as many buffs as you can on one character. 
	- You and the other guy quickly try to hype yourself up. 
	- Sigma male. It was always about the struggle. Even in death I will struggle. I will win. 
- Greed has multiple multiple multiple health bars and items. He took them all. 
	- This also makes it so you can't just one shot him right away. So that the fight is more about escalating hits. 
- Revenge. Third phase. Keshi and eji fucking someone up who’s just trying to heal and defend himself.  
	- Greed when he’s on his last few health bars.    You and eji are taking turns because. Only you guys have huge hitters. 
- Baton pass. Passes hype
	- Two v two. 
	- Pull the fucking trigger. Gunshot wounds to the face. 
- The Pit


What’s it all for
They’re not ready yet. 
You’re just being an ol fogey. You’ll never think they are. 
What was it all for.

- Greed attacks get super armor during his Catharsis
- Determination. You cannot cancel greeds attacks. I WAANT IT ALL. EVERYTHING. 



- Character who swipes your most precious item. 
	- I was saving that. 
	- Oh yeah? Gulp gulp gulp
	- Gah fuck that bitch. 
	- As if you were ever gunna drink that shit. People like you always waiting to live. 
	- Well guess what. We’re already fucking dead
	- Ha ha ha ha. Gotta piss. Why don’t you open your mouth wide and I’ll let ya get some of the after effects!  
- Determination: It doesn’t matter if your whole life was shit. Live live. Right now. This very second. Even if ots your last seconds. Especially cuz it’s your last seconds. Live. LIVE LIVEEEE
	- What if I fall down
	- You fight!
	- What if  I’m all alone there’s no one left. My family is gone. My friends are gone. There’s no one left to fight for. 
	- You fight!  Fight. Fight to the very end. 
	- What if I’m not even alive anymore. Fight!!!
	- Put on your suit. No. Your suit. 
	- Your thoughts diverging from feelings. 
	- Menu options all just say fight. Every iota of my being. 


Greed attacks you out of the gate. He offers a full heal but tells you to beg him for it. He will give you it but lose respect for you. 


- Cordyceps forces insects to go on higher. To release their spores. Similar motivation for riches and greed. Indoctrination.  God damn I’m fucking hard at this. 
- thinking for yourself and your own expression. She was Cordyceps. She gets infected. It's why she goes crazy. Wants the bag. Maybe her acceptance of what she wants is what allows her to fly up blow into the ceiling. 
- - Ate mushrooms, next day he left. Mushroom empire... 

- you target the top of greeds tower. Blast through a glass ceiling. Fly off into space. Land in a cloud look at each other. The slip through. Land on the roof. Mare you ready. 3! It blasts!
	- SMASH EM, RIP EM. 
	- Gaming elevators. 
	- Chi is now love. And love is... infinite. Love blasts exponentially take you higher. You’re trying to hit 999. Love operated exponentially because it’s a fractal. Getting hit or even defensive knocks you from love. The enemy is a misogynist that ignores Elise throughout the fight. Lets you get a massive love blast. 
	- It’s determined during fight with Elise. Elise blasting to sky to get to top of tower. Tower is at 999. Literally break through a glass ceiling. You have to give her a chance. Starts out depressed. 

# Old Mission 4
# Mission 4
- Sei is a reaper reaper. a rarity amongst rarities. someone who feels strongly but is still able to operate. even when forced to reap his friends 
- Your Job to kill last generation of reapers
- Ava: There’s reapers who hunt reapers. But who hunts the reapers who hunt the reapers who hunt the reapers? Is there an infinite list of somewhere? Or maybe it ends with him…


- first arc is revenge arc and destructive nature of emotions with Kacey
Eji isn’t allowed in the room during the discussion on what to do about a certain spirit. They go to execute the soft spirit. But he seems to be in control.

Ava is your physical partner when you eventually take down Sei. She openly yearns for the day she can take down Sei.

## **Your first Reaper Battle**

one day your target doesn't have too many descriptors. but one noticeable one is they have a lengthy coat which sei notices.

during the battle he will invade both your minds. sei will have depressing thoughts. it doesn't matter. if we die we die. eji will attempt to rouse himself out more positively. I can do this. don't let her get to you.

this reaper, keshi, is someone you'll commonly have interactions with throughout the game. maybe they'll be like eji. someone who cares too much. is too passionate.

eji struggles with mental battles but this represents a necessary turning point for him.

this is alluded to, that something like this happens and reapers can be targets until the midway battle when a reaper assaults your mind.

When they reap Kacey Eji can't take it. He doesn't want to be a robot. Sei tells him he isn't fit for the job then.

- Sei: I had high expectations for you.

there are a bunch of coffins in the background. one of them actually contains something. impression is that they’d have nothing.

> **Keshi**: I don’t want to do anything. I don’t have a passion in life. I don’t understand why I stayed behind. If anything I wished I would never have been born. Why am I still here, just to suffer...
> 



- Sound design
	- Teased by the distorted version of a song throughout a level when an anxiety attack kicks in. You help assauge keshi. Then I’m the final battle. When the music is playing over you. It’s the normal song. And you wait for the drop and it’s when the battle triggers. The song was the smoking weed with you. 

-  Bills for dog 
	-  Find another home made euthanizing. You realize he dying 
	-  He never actually made it to the top. On your descent you see him dead. You fight the guy who was always there. Or maybe his son. The whole game leads you to believe the person you follow is the guy you fight.
