- Maybe they all died in some shared tragedy. World lore is that mass tragedy is what births reapers. Something that reminds in the collective conscious of the people. 
	- Different tragedies mark each generation of reapers. Only vagueness is given to this lore. 
	- As lore gets increasingly far from supporting the plot. The more vague it is. Lore requires for the plot is very clear. In this case how everyone does. And why they die to young isn’t that important to the plot. So you can be vague about it. 
	- Everyone else died with strong wills. Why they wanted to live. Something they wanted to accomplish. So they instinctually hate eji. When keshi loses himself but it’s reborn. He’s still out of control because he knows eji died without will. This is in contrast with shounen protagonist where this is their primary strength. Willpower and friendship. Eji has no will. How did he preservers though. Anyways with keshi finds out he loses respect for him and challenges him. The player does not yet know what his past is. 
	- You never find out how any of the characters actually died. It’s implied to have been some shared event. Some disaster that they happened to be at the same time. Disasters always portend the next generation.
