- [ ] cutscene designer
	- [ ] Battle Intro
	- [ ] Cutins (detailed vs undetailed. possibly two objects for close ups?)
	- [ ] effect designer too?



- Habits
	- Maybe upload everything to github. To get an idea of commits per day. 
	- Upload art to github as well? lmao
	- Such as ideating scripts. I should learn script writing. 
- Art Effects
	- Gif loops for animations. Tiktok edit for jjk men. 
	- in n and out parallax effect... 
	- zoom in effect
	- visual consistency between portraits and CG
	- reconcile two characters talking that aren't MC.
	- Sacrifice fidelity for animation, (lighting?, multiplicative)
- Tech
	- markdown Like https://fountain.io/
	- look up other options on reddit
	- Script to cutscene. Display on web. Display animations. Scene generator. Animations and sounds. Ai voices. Get it twerking. 
	- vertical, web based
- Narratives
	- erotica
	- game scripts 
	- thoughts on masculinity. etc
	- When I deal with reconciliation. It's a conversation between two people. 
	- Oftentimes the ideals and the practicality of something. 
	- demonstrate through talking last... (things happening)
	- emotions 
- Inspo
	- Manhwa, VNs, Movies
	- Dohna Dohna: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuBt-MDCuro
	- Butterfly Soup Parallax


- Issues
	- I want to write scenes easily... 
	- Visual cohesiveness between CG's and dialogue
	- anime style captions 
	- movie style cuts?
	- because VN's don't force audio it has to show the character that is talking
	- auto advancing animations... (play this... do this)
	- maximize gameyness
		- most games focus on art fidelity, willing to sacrifice this for gameyness
		- light maps w/ movement
		- parallax 
		- gameplay
		- animations, gif loops
		- pans, cuts, auto advance
		- live 2d
