# Passive Ideation
- Tabs, Autocomplete, 
- Inspo
	- Jujutsu Kaisen: I will not work overtime
	- Hunter x Hunter: I will only use this ability on members of SPiders
- Traditional Passives
	- Incorporated into badge systems. Trades tactical depth for strategic depth by specializing builds. 
	- Or they're just part of the level up system. Something innate. 
	- Reduces in battle options to strengthen character builds. 
	- Would like to force characters to activate them. 
	- Small passives I don't really like. They should have some kind of impact. Covenants come with restrictions though.
			- To gain something you must lose something. 
	- Show in menu but unselectable
	- Emotions
		- Can turn your abilities unselectable. 
	- Chains
		- Doesn't interact with chains.
	- Interesting Examples: 
		- Determination. Survive KO once. 
		- Last attack (does something on death)
		- Gain more stamina while blocking
		- Increase Battle Rewards
		- Cast on battle start
- Toggles
	- Abilities you can click as you move through menus
		- You toggle a passive 
		- Maybe you even have to toggle deep and then exit out and the toggle will still apply. 
			- Increases freneticness.
		- Applies to next ability.
		- Competes with Traits.
		- Doesn't feel flavorful.
		- Toggles are generally per menu which increases frenetic nature. 
			- You toggle a covenant. They're just a special kind of toggle that's powerful. 


	- Examples
		- Sharpshooter. 2.25 damage but 50% chance to miss.
			- I would change this to rotation? Spins whatever effect you try to do. 
		- Magic Power: Increase MP use but damage increase.
	- Emotions
		- Emotion adds toggles to your menus. You have to close them out or suffer some kind of consequence. These always show up in the menus you click through. You don't have to find it.
			- These can be one time things though. They don't have to play into toggles. 
			- Okay I think I'll go with covenants. I like the idea that in order to get power you have to trade power in other ways. Balance.
		- Boss hides call of the void in characters thoughts. You have to root it out of your menu.
			- If you don't root it out, then characters strike themselves regardless of who you target.
			- EJI, I can't get this shit out of my mind. It's making me crazy. HELP ME. AGGHHHHHH.
			- You have to acknowledge the thoughts. 
				- this doesn't have to be a toggle. Could just be forced to use an ability before selecting what you actually want. But this means you could maintain a combo, it wouldn't break it.
- Covenants are powerful items characters use to declare rules they will follow in combat to gain access to passives or risk the consequences
	- They take the place of easy heal items which increase risk reward nature
	- Examples
		- Covenant of Affirmation.
			- I will find the affirmation. 
		- Covenant of Playfulness.
			- Activates Jankenbo menu. Which inherently has drawbacks. 
		- Covenant of Pacifism. 
			- I will not strike the enemy
			- Increases defense.
			- Failure decreases defense. 
		- Covenant of Independence. 
			- I will not rely on anyone again
			- Self buffs are stronger
			- Failure causes debuffs to hit harder
		- Covenant of Commitment
			- I will not take back my decisions
			- Hit harder
			- Failure is death
		- Covenant of Clarity
			- I will not take my time making decisions
		- Covenant of Confidence
			- I will not take damage
		- I will target highest health 
		- I will not die
		- Covenant of Physicality
			- I will not use magic.
			- Increases cast time. Increases stamina regen.
		- Covenant of Empathy
			- Emotions are doubled 
			- It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so very deeply. 


# Prototype States
- [x] Ideate States
- [ ] Review Emotion System
	- [ ] Negative and Positive Effects
	- [ ] Consider Conditions like Divinity for Applying Emotions to Enemies
- [ ] Ideate Incentives

# Ideate States
- States provide incentive to not just combo everything.
- Flow
	- can unlock options. 
		- unlocks different magic tiers
		- or magic at all
		- branching state options? (maybe unnecessary comlexity)
	- Discounts 
		- cast time
		- mp cost
		- can stack discounts?
	- Triggered from chaining physical attacks
		- Plus side, it converts a separate mechanic back into another mechanic. 
			- resonance is still it's own mechanic, perhaps it's built into flow as well. 
		- Flow states break you out of current state. which means you might not want to break out of your guard state to get into flow. 
			- On the other hand so if there are negative states in the game then simply chaining a physical attack can break a character out? 
				- current negative states ideation restrict menu choice though
		- Possibly hard to convey flow state happened since characters immediately go into a animation state. 
			- Also a chain is happening. so attack. attacker two goes into flow state 1. attacker three goes into flow state 2 immediately? 
				- perhaps it's individual. everyone only goes up one each time you chain. 
				- if you miss a trigger then you spend the MP
		- the mutually exclusive nature of states is hard to reconcile though.
			- it competes with defensive options which I don't think it should
				- there are defensive options that aren't state changes.
			- it also competes with offensive states. 
				- so now it's just competing with jankenbo.
- Potential States
	- Choking 
		- menu only lets you escape choking, struggle. something along those lines
		- Change this to grappling? Simple struggle? Maybe rock paper scissors style. Effect lmao. Jankenbo can be a special version of this. A competition state?
	- Execution State
		- Perhaps this is built into focus, menu unlocks at a certain flow state. 
	- 1v1 State, 
		- doesn't let anyone else target you.
		- Don't like the mutual exclusion aspect here. Can't defend...
	- Jankenbo State 
		- I want this to just be apart of chains so this should be an MP ability actually. 
			- How do menu manipulations trigger. You don't know if something resonates unless you hit the trigger. 
			- So many it has to be a state then. But then it competes with flow and it shouldn't. so maybe flow is not a state at least the physical ability triggered state. 
	- Manipulating 
		- Can select on enemy menu, uses MP until you do it
	- Chi 
		- Build up chi for super attack.
		- Log scale for chi. 
		- Has general usage to increase attack but some abilities use it. 
		- Elise has a chi bomb. 

- discarded ideas
	- literal copy cat of undertale
	- ffvii remake copy cat
	- Timing abilities to music

# Scrapped Abilities
- Avoid Complicated Math
	- Percentages
	- Damage scaling with Health
	- Ignore Defense
- Prefer Flavor
	- Stat Swapping
- Avoid Unfun Loops
	- Counter - MP Drain (Players will loop fights to fill MP)
- Avoid Manipulating Enemy State (Breaks many Gameplay Moments)
	- Shatter - Break enemy out of Guard Type States

# Action JRPG Ideation
# Action + Menu Combat 
1. Physical Attacks to fill Spell Gauge
2. Cast Spell using Spell System
3. Use Spells to wear them down to invade their Mind
4. Invade their mind to depress them
5. Reap them

Then in real life you fight normally using an ATB system. Real time action builds up an action bar where you enter their mind and inflict hell upon them.

Finally to execute them you have to swipe across their neck.

### Design - **Physical Attacks**
1. Standard attacks
2. Dash
3. Charge Attack

# Action JRPG Boss Battle Ideas
- [ ]  cannon battles - teleportation
- [ ]  running anime moment
- [ ]  enemy taunts you everytime you get hit

Charmed battle
- Eji you fucking simp
- What kind of girl do you like? 
Talk too much
- Dialogue starts covering up screen
- Overdose pharmacist 

Character who never misses
- "Iâ€™m never going to miss another shot.:
	- Bullets follow you but eventually dissipate. 

goading character

# Tarot Card Spell System
> Emotion system is already complex enough. Let's see how far we can take this before we add in other systems

Standard attacks charge magic. Cast magic via tarots. Use magic to be able to invade mind. Magic to enhance dash or force strike that invades minds.

Tarot card gameplay system

Tarot cards discuss changing the world from an individual

1. Random cards appear.
2. Connect cards to store magic.
3. Up to two spells.
4. Cast Spell by Tapping on Box until the spell is drained

Anything that adds to 13. Three in a row. Duplicates. You can activate multiple spells at once if you get more then one combo. Forces players to quickly look for options or they get knocked out of cast mode. I think there's a lot of merit to this system. It kind of makes me want to forget about the JRPG aspect since I can't think of a good way to incorporate it and I still want to do a dedicated JPRG.

#  Dual hp and stamina bars
> Emotion system is already complex enough. Let's see how far we can take this before we add in other systems

- hp is characters hitpoints
	- when hp is drained, max hp is damaged. 
	- when max hp is gone character is dead
- stamina is points for attacks
	- stamina slowly regains and you can use attacks as soon as you have the stamina for it
	- when stamina is drained, max stamina perma lowered to deal attacks or defend
	- when stamina is drained, character is exhausted and essentially removed from combat
- emotional state
	- if a character is full engrossed in emotional state then they can be killed?

# The Dullahan
> An idea for Sei's downfall. Didn't seem tragic enough though. 

The Dullahan. Sei's big mistake. His methods have produced a Dullahan. He's dulled the emotions of someone and broken them down. But the body lives on. It still moves with purpose. It wrecks havoc in the spirit world.

Reapers don't know how to handle Dullahans yet. They can only capture them and seal them.


# Sei's Old backstory - nah
- maybe sei has a family. a wife and a son and he had to raise his son. they died. or maybe the twist is that he's the son you assume the parallel of him acting as a father to you. but it becomes a generational thing. dead wife and son is stereotypical of this kind of character. maybe he was the dead son. or the wife? character is trans lol .

# disliked
- Other reapers donâ€™t like sei. You have to be willing to do anything. domains based on what they feel. Seiâ€™s domain is responsibility. A divine protector. He takes his job seriously and is the best. If you take on everything yourself how can you let others grow. Sei wants you to take on the responsibility. To shed your weakness, to grow and to take down others. In a way he wins and he loses. I cannot be told what to do. 
> Why does everyone hate sei
> He... gets the job done. 


# Conversation Weakpoints 
Can target nouns in dialogue. Using proper Talk against nouns results in highly damaging effects
- Mock someone's accent
- Someone's name is actually target, they're lieing about who they are 
- Targeting a noun with talk will nullify the effect if it doesn't make sense
- Conversation has time limit, have to quickly react to what they're saying (with right char?)
- When they attack they say something... 

# The Hikkimori
How do I create a character with any depth?
He's a guy who's isolated in his room. He didn't want to do anything. How can he relate to the rest of the world. How did he work. He wanted to open the door but he couldn't. What kind of attacks would he do. He wants to avoid people. Any accountability. So he can increase his dodge rate. Increase his accountability. Or his depression. You have to work through vulnerabilities in the right order.. You can't just guess. Everyone is vulnerable to depression... which is what makes it effective. You can effectively fly through the end game this way as well. 


ðŸ˜³ maybe emoji's isn't the right move lol. 

# Positivity in Emotions
- lost souls have positive emotion triggers that will cause them.
	- there are some emotions that are clearly buffs that you need to use on souls.
	- they increase the difficulty of the fight but winning despite that means their soul ascends peacefully. the collected soul after isn't not tainted. it's purely a visual effect though. there's no reward for doing this. 
	- some should exist since the beginning of the game. 
	- they should be fairly simple buffs on stats, etc

-  ideate potential positives from emotions that could have always existed from the beginning
	-  yes anger makes you single minded but in a way doesn't that make you focused? Have you noticed your attacks deal more damage (although you also take more) 
	- the big lore drop is that if you make yourself emotional enough in battle you get access to more interesting options and stat changes. 


# discarded ideas related to current setup
- action commands: tap attack window to increase or decrease effectiveness of ability
- Combos take trait from previous move? Not really skeumorphic. 

# Chain Stancing
- Traits apply to states?  Splash counter. Most absorb counter. 
- Guard
	- Guard + Splash = Cover
	- Guard + Added Cut = Counter
	- Guard + Drain = Convert Fraction of attack to health, stamina, 
	- Guard 

- Guard stance would conclude a chain 

GUARD,
PERFECTGUARD // DODGE,
REFLECT,
FOCUS -> Increased stamina regen

## Ideate Keywords
- STATE change
	- counter
	- switch to guard state after attacking
	- dodge
	- guard state
	- reflect
	- resurrect dead teammate


### Ideas
- Flee State - cost a lot of stamina, all characters have to flee to escape.
- Delay cast time to charge attacks. 
	- Slow down effect in animations. Or maybe on hit time?  Inspired by slowdown nanami Tiktok. Slow to fast.  
- Whenever you combo or Perfect guard. You slow down combat. And give yourself more time to think. 
- Dead teammates eventually pick themselves back up (takes forever)
- There's enemies who will continue attacking downed teammates 
- Status are in battle states that change how other gameplay systems play out. 
- Stagger, can't move for one sec, attacks reset 
- Cover - Protect other characters

### Dropped State Ideas
- Manipulate, control enemy menu, lose ap while active 


# Why Not Restore MP instead of Discount
- Inspired by materia system that allowed you to 'program' your abilities.
	- This moves into ingame implementation that allows for creative expression during battle as well to chain what abilities you need
- Discounts versus restores: Not restore because it makes Magic the default response then physical to restore. Discounting means physical is the default, then take advantage of magic, then spend MP in emergency situation when you need to. 
	- Tension of climbing out the hole versus when to use your MP

# Juggling
- Juggling mechanic. 
	- Maybe attacking someone staggers their menu. But you gotta attack them. 
	- Overpower. Pressure. Juggling. Spam while charging attacks. 
	- feels like you're applying pressure. Maybe can go with Final Flow mechanics?
	- low stamina jab. Can easily get them out. Low cast. 


# Old Catharsis and Emotion System
- Ultimate Abilities 
- Rip off neck piece to u leash Bankai. Restraints. 
- Trigger as a result of having a certain amount of emotions and triggering a high combo. 
- Removes all Emotions
- Fundamentally changes rules of combat based on character.
- Cancels other Catharsis
- Inspired by Domain Expansions and Bankai 
	- the trend on tiktok: SOUKAMANA
- Lust domain. All abilities effect everyone
	- Invert decisions. Colors are inverted and binary decisions are inverted.

| Catharsis    | Effect                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pride        | Only people in effect can target each other           |
| The Observer | Predicts Enemy Attacks, Glowing                       |
| Eji          | Infinite Health, Future Sight, Predict Enemy Outcomes |
| Keshi        | Infinite Stamina                                      |
| Girl         | Infinite MP                                           |
| Greed        | Cast time replaced by super armor                     |
| Gojo Satoru  | Infinite cast time on incoming attacks                |
| The Deaf     | Removes Music and Sounds                              |
|              |                                                       |
## Emotions
- Combatants have emotional state 
- Emotions have different trigger thresholds... the amount of emotion you are feeling. emotions combined. 
	- It's extremely difficult to remove emotions as well. 
	- Emotions are meant to build up over the course of a battle to change the conditions of battle besides just set pieces and phases. 
- Higher level emotions is can happen early game but is rare because enemies simply don't deal emotional damage. eventually they can be emotionally crippling
- Avoid simple stat changes
- Avoid removing player agency
- They should encourage misclicks

### Potential Future Emotions
- Increase stamina refill rate
- Increase max stamina (for longer combos?)
- depressed - increase cast time, lower sp regen
- euphoria - decrease cast time, increase sp regen
- bewildered - mix letters
- high confusion - mix options between multiple menus
- regret - increase cost of last used option
- blur the bg when navigating menus
- Mirror sensations 
- Stamina refunds
- Analog Horror Emotion in Menu - regreet
	- DO NOT ENGAGE
	- DO NOT ENGAGE
	- DO NOT ENGAGE
	- DO NOT **ENGAGE**
### Discarded Emotions

| Emotion   | Effect                          | Reason         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Disgust   | Increase Dodge Rate             | Stat Change    |
| Repulsed  | Damage over Time                | No counterplay |
| Afraid    | Lowers attack                   | Stat change    |
| Petrified | Paralyzed                       | Removes agency |
| Anger     | Increase damage taken and given | Stat Change    |

# Dropped Mechanic - Curses and Covenants
- Design

## Design

- Potency
    - consider covenant and curse potency (can scale via combos)
        - shields can scale, heals can scale
    - if curses have potency then you can recast... you don't really need to have such uniqueness?
        - that way there's no overlap in restrictions?
- Covenant
	- Positive Power
	- Additional Restrictions
- Curse 
	- Maybe positive triggers aren't known and have to be discovered
    - Negative Passive
    - Positive Trigger,
    - Examples
        - Vow Effect -> Replace counters with chained move...
        - Final attack - drain health, chained move on death + aoe efect
        - Can act while exahusted
    

- Trigger Ideation    
    - Death
    - Counter
    - Kill
    - Chase - on Attack
    - Block - on block
    - On Enter
    - Some of these were states before.... like counter.
    - On status, on vow, on restriction violation
    - on heal
    - on combo
    - on timer?
- Negative Triggers, Positive buffs
    - on full stamina (excited) character just attacks and break vow or else you lose double the stamina you gained. hunter's devotion.
        - this should be the new covenant actually. increased stamina regen but don't let it top out.
    - on shield removal (powerful buff), slowed shield decay
    - slow bleed, must always bleed, dealt damage -> beserker's vow (makes it easier?)
- Assassin Vow. Target lowest health combatant. Additional damage.
- Berserker Vow. Increased damage. Vow is to attack the highest health combatant. Otherwise debuffs damage. And then when your people have higher health you turn off the vow.
- Hunter's Mark - Curse that lowers stamina regeneration

# Spell Modifier Magic Syste
- progression magic - must do more damage?
- single use
- Form Progression = Stance Progression
- Tabs = stances (calm stance vs wrath stance)
- Type Target
    - Attack is more powerful (but you have to type name of target)
- Spam Button
- magic unlock new options
- Magic combinations unexpected effects 
- Magic can target
- Continuously surprise
- magic switches target and action order

# Dropped Mechanic - Vows
- Inquisitor - Vow Killer
    - Must have broken a vow
- Sovereign - Flagbearer (Makes Vows that Buff their Allies)
    - Vow of Pacifist - I will not attack my enemies, strengthens attack of allies. Breaking this vow means debuffing ally attacks.
