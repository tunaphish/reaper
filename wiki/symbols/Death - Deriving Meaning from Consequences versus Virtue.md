- [[Sei - The Mentor The Reaper]] perceives that death causes meaning to be lost when derived from self. You die anyways so who cares. Only your legacy and what you've done matters. 
	- The struggle to live forever. To influence change. To influence beyond your life. To leave your legacy.
	- Immortality is a curse though.
	- - Live as a man. But you move beyond that. A whole generation moves beyond it.
		- In order for new ideas to give birth. Old ones have to die
- [[Eji - The Empath]] learns that death gives life itself meaning. "We will never be more beautiful than we are now". 
	- Death Provides a cycle of renewal. Old ideas die so new ones can be born. 
	- With Death comes meaning. Meaning from domains. The world. Relationships. Yourself.

# Reincarnation
- I like reincarnation because it means the earth is heaven and hell. If you make the world a better place, you come back to an earth more like heaven, if you make it a worse place you come back to an earth more like hell. 
- What if you don't do anything to effect the world at all?
- You come back to a world shaped entirely by other people. 

# Regrets
- reaper explores the question how do you live a life without regrets...
	- how do you minimize regret each day explores a different facet of that question

# **Just Living Life**
Life is a reality to be experienced. 
- Eji - I mean it's not even about the fame at that point. like why even perform if only five dudes are going to listen.
- Sei - because those five dudes understand. and that's all that matters.


# **Nihilism vs Living Life**
- Nietzsche recognized early in life that nihilism is going to be the bane of human existence. Life literally doesn't have purpose beyond survival. We can overcome it by pursuing passion, art, self ownership and struggle.
- Retire? Retire... and do what. What do you even do after work? Retire and go home and live your shitty life contributing nothing to society. At least here we're doing something.
- Don't need to contribute anything to society. Can't I just exist?
- One of the endpoints of [[handling emotions and regrets]] and perception. How do you get past nihilism. That nothing you do matters. 

- Sometimes you can’t. Sei's philosophy is you can’t. Accept your despair. Accept that nothing could have been done. Eji is you can try. Strive. Leave it to the next generation. Nihilism. eji is naive though. I’ll do what I want. Idealistic. Sei is practical.
	- And you still live a life of regrets anyways.
	- Who gives a fuck. Life is to be lived and your meta commentary and attempts at self awareness are disgusting. Just die already. Your apathy is pathetic.
- Alternative route vs nihilism but leaving things for the new generation and trusting that they will get it done. Starts as a story about nihilism but then evolves into a story about passionate feelings vs other passionate feelings? Act of reaping is either crushing their hopes. Or giving them hope. 
- Emotions are not a distraction. It's dehumanizing. It's is what derives purpose. 

# changing generations
- Last seen 10 years ago
- the current generation reaper's job is to reap the old generation. snip them out basically. sei defies this by staying alive... in the sense he never really needs to be hunted. he just wants to though. generally he's the only one who can put them down. he's the strongest... GOJO SATORU...
- playing with other characters: emotions erupt.
	- you get their soul after...
	- the danger is always there.. 
	- I don't know what the overarching story is at that point then. 
	- you're fighting lost souls. 
	- figuring out the back story for everyone. 
	- inverse of getting allies members is the best part... 
		- team 3. 
		- empathy and inviting emotions unto yourself. 
- You’re not a reaper until you take down a friend. What’s the overarching narrative then. 
- The new batch is smaller this year
	- Kids these days. Don’t know how to appreciate a gift. 
	- Hey don’t say that. Maybe theyre smarter. Maybe they learned to accept it.
