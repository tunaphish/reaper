# Reason versus Emotions
- Early on Sei teaches you that combat is battle between Emotion and Reason.
	- The way you are able to think about your actions and move through menus represents reason. 
	- They way emotions make it difficult to select the options you want to select represent how emotions tend to cloud your decision making. 
	- Initially Eji, has a trait that doubles the effect of emotions on him. 
	- All Enemies will start battles and phases by inflicting their core emotion. 
	- Sei teaches Eji the ability Stifle which removes all emotions. 
	- Eventually, the game teaches you that if you work through your emotion you gain access to more interesting options and effects. 
		- (There's a hidden emotional intelligence effect?)
- Ultimately a story about emotions. How they make us human. How men are taught to stifle their emotions to better society but the true benefit to society would be people who are able to tame both. Some people can't though...


- Combat is an allegory for nihilism. By empathizing with how someone feels you are able to feel what they feel and when it comes time to execute them they free themselves. Alternatively if you stifle how you feel. When it comes time to execute them you tell them that their life was meaningless. Their emotions fade away and you slice the head off a regular person.
- reapers must be reapt. they cannot absolve how their reason
	- this is sei's misunderstanding. just because this is your fate. doesn't change how you feel on the way.
	- you always had the option to empathize with your enemies. fuck am I really making a clone of Undertale. 
	- - mission one you fight one of the sins. they defy reaperdom but allowing their emotions to take over. but they actually use emotions to fight.
	- implement reaper action.
		- steady my blade
		- calm my heart
		- feel the passion
		- REAP

# Catharsis
- Ultimates. By working through your emotions but coming through the other side. You're able to have an incredible release of energy.
- Everyone gets white hair during domain expansion. Sei always had it. You were always in his domain.

# Caring
- one of the themes of the game is fighting versus passiveness. when characters give up. when they stop fighting. they stop caring. they opt out of life. 
- but when you keep fighting. you keep trying. characters often say. can we not fight. can we just stop. but you have to fight. even to the end
- - Sei always expressed that he does not like fighting. That it’s a necessary evil. So one reason for not getting emotional about it is so you can do your duty. But the other reason not to have positive emotion is because it’s not something to be admired. He doesn’t like it. Because it causes pain. But it is good. The pain is good. The struggle. The anxiety. The suffering. The loss. It’s all good. Without bad. No good. 
	- The suffering. How can you smile eji. 
	- Because. I’m alive. 
	- Not liking fighting. Just keeping to yourself. 
	- in the end of the day. sei is a fighter. he cares.
- You have to make them give up on fighting. 
- Celebrate fighting
