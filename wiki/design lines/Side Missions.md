- Stories are dumb analogies
	- dumb shit that characters care about
- most stuff in a game should be side missions
- design line for a game should be extremely short

- One day a hawk took a linking to me and we saw each other often. One day the hawk came to me injured so I wrapped his leg in a bandage. After a few days I realized I had not seen the hawk in a while so I went to search for it. I found the bird dead and tangled in a tree. Trapped in makeshift bandage I gave to him. 

- I’ve been waiting for my wife but I can’t find her. Please help me find her, I just need to make sure she’s safe. You find out he died a long time ago. She must have died as well. Help me find her then. She can’t have gone on without me. You find out she moved on and found love again. Already left the world. You never realized because she changed her last name after she remarried.

# Relationship Builders

	- Fuck em eji! They’re vultures in this capatlistic system

# Unsorted

- My time has come. My time has come.
	- second place regret

- We have to take him off life support
	- I can’t let you do that. 

- Protect Eji while he performs the execution!
	- The greatest danger. Occurs at the moment of victory. Anger bucks the execution and brings down keshi with him. Reflected Keshi's kill...
- Eren and armor titan in basement. Triggers fight.
- My drill is the drill. Learning from your mentor. 
- Navigate someone’s menu. All they’re thinking about us kill.  
- Damaged. Self targeting. Targeting dead person.
- Get into a pissing content. Punch for punch. If you bail you suffer moral victory. But you can avoid it just by getting knocked out. I won’t ever step. I won’t ever back down. Eji we burn the fucking ships. Either he goes down. Or I do. 
- The eight gates is a technique of destruction. He didn’t do it to die. He did it to be Alive
