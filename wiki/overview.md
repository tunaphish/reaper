# Story Structure
1. Weakness and Need: Eji can't control his emotions. Lashes out and picks actions randomly. In danger of becoming a lost soul. He has empathy. But that empathy forces him to look away from others. And look away from himself. This caused him to die without any meaning to his life. His death bed he looks back and he never gave it any meaning.At first he learns to stifle his emotions. Sei gives him purpose as a reaper. But that's not enough. The journey is to learn to act in the face of emotion. Because your actions aren't what give life meaning. Sure you can go through life like a robot. But what gives life meaning is what you feel. What you feel through others. The empathy. It's hard... caring for others. Helping them through their trauma, and them helping you through yours. But it's worth it. Therefore... the friends along the way.
2. Desire: Find out why he stayed behind in the after life. The people who stayed behind feel strongly. Eji's story of acting in the face of emotion. or perhaps eji finds struggle in his everyday life. his desire is to find the ailment to his lack of desire? the desire is to find purpose. Purpose wasn't in becoming a reaper who can reap others. but someone who can help and be amongst others. THE FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY.
3. Opponent: Sei - There is no Meaning to Life. The Reaper. We all die. Who cares. 
4. Plan&Battle: Confront Sei in the Snowfield
5. Self Revelation:  Act in the face emotion... don't stifle them and yourself
6. New Equilibrium: A life of stoic driven purposefulness isn't the way, let yourself go and be free. you can feel things as well. don't let them out of control. don't stifle them. but act in the face of your emotions. live with them and everything they bring. 

# Premise
Reaper is the journey of a young man, Eji, who died and is seeking purpose as a reaper in the after life with his 2 companions and mentor Sei exploring a nostalgic but modernized world of old school JRPGs and vintage anime to find clues on how to take down Lost Souls using the Emotion System to manipulate enemy behavior and avoid having their emotions manipulate them. 

# Moral Theme
Reaper explores the moral theme of finding purpose in consequentialist duty versus finding purpose in being true to yourself and how you feel. After dying Eji is confronted with taking advantage of 'another life' and using that to live the best life he can. His mentor Sei, gives him a goal and the means to achieve it... but is this what Eji wants?

Your emotions are not an obstacle in the pursuit of purpose, they are in fact the means of expressing it. By stifling Emotions and focusing on Reason, you become dehumanized and are thus unfit to make consequentialist decisions that affect humanity. 

Emotions and community provide purpose, not desire.
