- fixing atb
- healing as an archetype, incremental pressure, dungeon tension
- - prototyping with react and phaser
- what I didn't want in my battle system
	- Real Time Elements... 
		- This is kind of weird because it's still Action Time based but I didn't want mini games to determine efficacy of strategies. I wanted quick thinking and execution of strategy
	- Weakness/Elemental 
		- Typically comes down to trying a variety of attacks until you figure out what their weakness is and then spamming that weakness. 
	- Stat bloat 
		- Complexity, too many mathy calculations
- defy the idea that menuing is a necessary evil and make it a fun abstraction
	- tension between ATB and menu navigation to accomplish all the things you want to accomplish
- - knock on effects design 
	- no mp, player stall
	- just full heal instead
	- no dungeon tension
	- score system
	- linear progression to ensure reasonable progress, doens't open til game does
	- alternatively no healing
- Crunchy combat informing exposition, narrative, etc
