Sei represents the masculine ideal. What men want to strive for even beyond selfish reasons. He sacrifices himself so that others may live. He sees that Eji has that same capability.

# Arc: The Reaper Reaper
Reapers are already a rare breed. The ones left behind. That will pave the way for others  That will gift them the afterlife. But the reapers. The ones who can give that to their friends. Their comrades. Sei feels that responsibility and duty are fading from this world. His answer is that because people aren't able to put away their feelings to do what is needed. Eji's answer is that because they don't feel anything... is why. 

A purpose in life. Someone who can help their fellow reaper move on. Sei can't go until that happens.  He feels no positivity in life anymore. He's gone on for long he found out and forgot why he's even persisted. But now he has a new strong feeling. A sense of duty. For the reapers who can't do what he needs to do. 

Sei’s hypocrisy is that he cannot move on either despite his control. His is the weight of responsibility. To save others from violence you must be capable of inflicting great violence. His perception for life and meaning.


- as you click on a dialogue box the health tickets down further and further. you go through the death of so many reapers (sei dlc) or backstory

- Training you such that you can put him to death. 
- I’ve never met another reaper that can put me on my knees. Let’s see your best shot. 
- Making you think that sei is the bad guy.

- The final lesson our fathers teach us is that we are truly alone. But in those final moments. When the light of your life comes to its end. It is the reapers job to walk you to the unknown. Let this be your final lesson eji. Which lesson you learn. Which path you take. Is up to you. 
	- Song. Dark side
- - That dread you are feeling. When you know you must take the life of a fellow reaper. It never leaves. You steel your heart because the dread will overwhelm you otherwise. 
- That existential fear you are feeling. When you know that one day. Someday. You must pass that burden onto another. It never leaves. It only grows stronger until one day you can no longer bear it. You still your heart because it will overwhelm you otherwise. 
- Will you succumb to your human nature. Or will you walk the path of the reaper
	- I will walk my own path of the reaper
- What was this all for. If I always could've been happy. Don't tell me it was always possible. 
	- Regret. 
	- What's the point of
	- Knowing this now. 
	- No I don't want to know. I don't want to learn. 
	- I still remember her face. Why was I so hollow. What was this all for. What was I chasing. 
	- How far are you willing to go to achieve your goal. 
	- You constantly try to inflict happiness to keep her from losing herself to darkness. Phase 2
	- Do you truly believe what you are saying. Look at us eji. There's nothing to be happy about. Why are we even still here. Even if I don't lose it. What are we going to do when we have to reap sei. 
	- What are we going to do eji. Fill him with some bullshit happiness. You know it's pointless you know it fades. You know. We are hollow. 


- Sei: I'm not exactly sure why. But reapers are becoming more and more scarce... 
- Sei: That doesn't even account for those reapers...
- Elise: Those reapers?
- Sei: Nevermind let's keep moving... 

- Elise: How long has Sei been a reaper?
- Ava: To be honest, I am not sure. 
- Ava: He's been a reaper as long as me, my mentor, and their mentor has been reapers. 
- Elise: What? He never moved on?
- Ava: There's meaning to be found, even in death. 

- Eji: Go then. Just go already. 
- Sei: I... cannot. Not until I know there's someone who can do what needs to be done. 
- Sei: Ava... Elise... 
- Sei: .........
- Sei: You. Who will make sure you all move on. 
- Eji: When will you move on then. 
- Sei: Whenever the time does or does not come

- Sei: You're doing well fighting the lesser souls.
- Eji: They're more... abstract.


- Sei Break up Dialogue
    
    What is it that you think I do in there?
    
    Our job is to tel — 
    
    to remind them. Their job, their home, their clothes, watches, cars. 
    
    Their families... loved ones...
    
    That their hopes, their dreams... their lives.
    
    Everything.
    
    Is all meaningless. 
    
    That when you die, it's all over.
    
    That's it. That was your life. 
    
    No ...
    
    You're wrong. 
    
    You wouldn't be standing here if you truly believed that. 
    
    I know deep down. 
    
    You have to
    
    You have to believe there was a point. 
    
    No, I don't.
    
    I'm here because there is a job to do and that's it. 
    
    You'd be wise, to treat it the same. Otherwise... you should just go ahead and move on too. 
    
- Is this really a big deal. Am I being melodramatic. You have option to help sei or keshi during the reading moment. A lesson will be learnt either way. Keshi gets depressed. Emits only depressed emojis. When all emojis and overwhelmingly negative they can be dealt. You can also let them ascend by making them feel overwhelming positive emotions.

- Please, I'm begging you. It doesn't have to be like this. 
- Violence is a fact of life. In an ideal world there'd be no need. But we're not there yet. and until the time comes it needs people like me. And people like you. 
- No... no no no no. 
- Eji... yes. I took you in because I knew you could do it. Reapers are already a rare breed. But the ones who can watch the watchmen. 
- I'm tired. I.. always knew you'd be the one Eji. 

- when does it stop? when does it turn off? when can you relax? when you're skin in bone. when can you reap the effort that you worked so hard for?
- this is isn't for me to reap. it's for everyone else. this is what we do this is what we're here for. we take on the pain others can't. we do the things others won't. we have to provide and protect. keshi was a beautiful soul. he wept for others. he cried freely. and he died for it. because he couldn't fulfill his purpose. his job. 

- - Eji their pain isn't real. Yours is a reaction to theirs. Cut that part of yourself off. It will make you weak. 

- Your only misunderstanding eji. Is that you would find purpose in any other life. The truth is.  No matter what you do. No matter how honorable. Dishonorable. It all ends the same. With that gnawing feeling. Eating you. Clawing away everything you ever loved. Until you are dead before your heart ever stops beating. 
	- Sei is talking about himself. You find meaning in putting your friends. Until you don't.
	- What happens if you are meant to stay forever. Then everything eventually loses all meaning.

- Everyone has to die. Otherwise you’ll eventually get weighed down by the suffering. How can it not weight you down after enough time. 
	- cosmic giggle. how can i laugh in the face of all this suffering


- you can’t change. Only death can beget change. Except he does
	- At the end. Others deaths affect us. 
	- I was there eji. I was always there. 
- - Sei can only be executed during catharsis used to cancel his - for emotional build up.
- - Sei is made to be a villain because he never tells you can let them go peacefully. But it doesn’t matter. They go either way. But it does matter. It matters to us. But the more you empathize. The more you risk turning as well. 

- There’s some vague idea that the world is propped up by sei to give himself purpose and will be propped up by eji after. 
- You can reap your mentors. You can reap your peers. You can reap your mentees?
