- - [ ] By stacking layers, you can add a ton of depth to environments and even interface elements. One of my personal favorites is to add a nearly-transparent "dust layer" that mostly just drifts about, but responds to nearby movement and/or u interactions. It's subtle, but adds tangibility.

- - [ ] Small delay before health starts ticking
- - [ ] There are also a ton of animation tricks, and even lighting tricks to make sprites look 3D. Terraria, for example, gets loads of mileage out of their sprites by tinkering with shaders
